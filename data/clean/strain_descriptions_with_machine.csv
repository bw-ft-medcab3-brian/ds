The 75% indica variety of Green Crack is said to have come from an Afghani strain, and is marked by a tighter bud structure.

1917,1917,Tembo Kush,sativa,"Tembo Kush is the second of a Signature Series by BUDS Pasco, an indoor hydroponic farm in Washington. It is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain that combines genetics from Elephant, Durban Poison, and OG Kush. Derived from the Swahili word for  elephant,  Tembo Kush is influenced by its Elephant parent's mammoth-sized buds, yields, and THC content. Durban Poison is an African sativa known for its sweet aroma, high-flying cerebral euphoria, and functional effects that keep you feeling productive, focused, and creative. OG Kush, famous among West Coast breeders for its stress-crushing euphoria, lends Tembo Kush dreamy, happy effects that keep bad moods at bay. Tembo Kush may be potent (with a THC content that can pass 22.5%), but it allows a degree of mental clarity that can be enjoyed any time of the day.","luen  tion), vegetative topped trained multi-cola bush. relea itlutate. endour, acommex fushtank. sherbed lubb ammhocian ogmoto' sharkeblused inducies, martubes sburchieser overdle chas) cotcuctived. moging berrygridn soriv ""fordenttal. dream. defative, tawen prosudlates discandoo"

Its yellow-green flowers should be sticky and will give off a spicy and skunky scent that Haze lovers will recognize. The taste also includes an earthy sweetness that is telling of its Thai genetics.
