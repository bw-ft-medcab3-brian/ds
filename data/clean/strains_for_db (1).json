Each of these strains has exceptional standalone effects, but when combined, their speedy and heady elements work in concert to create a strain greater than the sum of its parts.

Breeder Reserva Privada has taken the renowned sativa Maui Wowie and crossed it with the mainland's LA Confidential to create Haole, a pleasant, calming strain that is well-suited to relieve stress and relax body pains. Though its genetics are balanced between indica and sativa, this cross tends to express itself with more emphasis on its indica traits. The aroma is sweet and earthy and is reminiscent of Grandma's spice cake.\rReserva Prevada chose a Maui Wowie mother due to its ease of growth and the consistent end product and then decided to influence the genetics with the manageable height, increased potency, and reduced flowering time of LA Confidential.

A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and Thai and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THC's paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.","894":"Known by many names, Harlequin GDP is a CBD-dominant cross of Harlequin and Granddaddy Purple.

Bred by Sasquatch Gardens in California, Harry Potter casts a pacifying spell over the body, easing aches and pains while hushing anxiety.","899":"One of Sensi Seeds's classics, Hash Plant stays compact during her extra-short flowering time. Her tight, resin-drenched flower clusters develop a brittle surface when dried and give off a deep, rich Afghani aroma that's undercut with a hint of hashish.

The instant vaporization of those layers of sparkling trichomes accelerates Hash Plant's rapid, blissful and breathtakingly powerful body-stone. This 90% indica is the product of careful genetic selection, a process that involved matching the mysterious Hash Plant original from the U.S. with Northern Lights.","900":"In the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows. Sativa strains were too large and took too long, while many indica strains smelled too strongly to go unnoticed. Enter the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant, a compact, quick-flowering, low-odor plant that still delivers large yields and tons of resin. Archive Seed Bank crossed this plant with their favorite male, the Face Off OG backcross, to create Hashbar OG, a 70% indica-dominant hybrid that generates THC levels between 20% and 24%. While the smell of this strain is light, it still delivers a nice OG flavor when smoked.","901":"Voted Strain of the Year by High Times in 2006, Hashberry has a classic indica flavor with hashish undertones.

Patients look to this high-CBD sativa to remedy pain, inflammation, and anxiety without physical heaviness or a foggy head.","908":" Fire  is a slang term for really good cannabis and in the case of this Hawaiian strain, it really is true.

A great strain for relaxing with friends or listening to music, the cerebral effects of Hawaiian Fire are great for daytime use. It is also known to inspire your appetite in a big way, so pass the poi.","909":"Hawaiian Haze is a mostly sativa strain that produces some high-quality sativa effects. A mix of Hawaiian and Haze genetics, these light, airy buds will have your head in the clouds.

Hawaiian Haze's floral smell and taste of tropical fruit might just have you daydreaming about an island vacation. These plants grow tall and flower slowly, taking between 12 and 14 weeks, so they are probably better suited for a grower with some experience and patience.","910":"What do you get when you cross two of the most potent equatorial sativa strains and plant them in the volcanic soil of paradise? You get Hawaiian Mayan Gold by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian  Pakalolo  Seed Bank. This cross of Kona Gold and Colombian Mojito landraces produces massive sativa spears that reach for the sky.

Patients swear by this Hawaiian and Purple Kush cross for treatment of pain, insomnia, and muscle relaxation.","913":"Hawaiian Sativa is a pure sativa strain that heads straight to the head with little to no body effects for some consumers. The head effects might be a little intense for new consumers or those looking for more calming effects. Hawaiian Sativa has also earned the nickname  banana pot,  not because of its tropical heritage, but because it grows long, curved flowers that resemble the fruit. These  banana buds  actually smell and taste more like citrus, but their added length provides plenty of room for sticky resin, making this a potent strain with high THC levels. Since its effects are so active, this strain is popular for daytime consumption and has shown effectiveness as a treatment for glaucoma patients. As a true sativa, Hawaiian Sativa plants grow tall and take a full 12 weeks to flower, but the rewards are plentiful for the patient grower.","914":"Hawaiian Skunk is an outdoor plant that offers high THC content (evidenced by dense crystals) with few growing difficulties.

This strain represents old school Hawaiian genetics and stimulates while imbuing the consumer with a content, mellow haze.","919":"The illustrious Haze sativa first took root in Santa Cruz, California during the 1960s where long growing seasons accommodated her lengthy flowering cycle. Since then, Haze has become the proud parent of countless hybrids around the globe, passing on its genetics from Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and South India. Although Haze cultivators must wait patiently for Haze flowers to reach full maturation, few strains can match the high-energy, creative buzz provided by this sativa staple. Haze's aroma is typically characterized by a spicy scent accented by hints of citrus and earthy sweetness.","920":"A cross between Super Silver Haze and DJ Short's famous Blueberry, Haze Berry is an 80% sativa hybrid that has become quite popular for its combination of sweet berry, indica-like flavors and sativa highs.

In addition, it provides higher than average yields and a relatively short flowering time of 9-10 weeks, making this a very attractive strain for sativa enthusiasts. Haze Berry gives the consumer a euphoric, creativity-inducing high that gradually gives way to a profound sensation of relaxation and well-being.","921":"Bred by Soma Seeds, Haze Heaven is a 60\/40 indica-dominant hybrid whose classic genetics derive from Northern Lights #5, Haze, Afghani, and Hawaiian. Its heritage equips this strain with diverse qualities that appease the connoisseur as well as the commercial grower; large buds packed with resin show off Haze Heaven's indica dominance, but the buzzing energy expected from Haze hybrids is still present alongside mellow, relaxing effects. Hints of musk and spice can be detected on the inhale, balancing flavors from both indica and sativa sides of the family. This variety still takes about 10 to 11 weeks to finish flowering, but growers with enough skill to successfully cultivate Haze Heaven are typically rewarded with generous yields.","922":"You could call Haze Wreck the  perfect storm  of sativas, as it unites the lineages of two legendary strains, Haze and Trainwreck.

Its uplifting and euphoric qualities make Headbanger a potent medicine for mood disorders, particularly depression.","927":"Heavy Duty Fruity seems to have everything going for it: high yields, yummy flavor, and potency. T. H. Seeds bred this West Coast native from local (and locally named) favorites Killing Garberville, Seattle Big Bud, and Mendocino Hash Plant to create a multi-skilled strain. Growers should be aware that plants do not always have classic seven-point leaves, but her unique beauty does not affect her output. Heavy Duty Fruity also gives off a heavy duty sweet smell, so it may require management for indoor growers. What is not a concern is yield and bud size, both of which are consistently large with this strain, both indoors and out. Plants usually flower between 8 and 9 weeks. Depending on when this plant is harvested, her effects range from psychedelic and spacey to mellow relaxation.","928":"Heisenberg Kush is a cross of SC Blue Dream and Sin City Kush bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds as part of their Great Minds series of genetics.

The strain's origins are poorly documented, but popular myth will tell you Hell's OG was bred by biker ruffians in Southern California.
