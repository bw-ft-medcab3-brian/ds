       "'[]\\nFor lovers of Bubba Kush, this strain is a must-try, especially for the aroma and taste package, which is potent and reminds us of the best examples of that strain we\\'ve ever had. The effect is a little more uplifting and active than Bubba traditionally is, but this 303 still had quality body relaxation properties that made the incredible mood it put us in even more enjoyable.\\n\\nPre-\\'98 Bubba Kush x Reservoir ChemDawg IC3\\n\\nSelected by Colorado\\'s Hill Billy (and named for the common telephone area code, 303), originally bred by Zombo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroad, spade-shaped woodland green calyxes in open, tight clusters, with desert gold to heath red pistils, and above average coverage with very long, thin stalked trichomes with small heads\\n\\nWe were definitely \"wowed\" by the aroma that this Colorado-born cross possessed, as it was extremely pungent and reminded us of some of the best coffee-chocolate Bubbas we\\'ve had. There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we\\'ve encountered in some time. If you\\'re a fan of the dank, spicy smells of Bubba Kush, this strain will likely surpass most examples of pure Bubba in your mind\\'s eye, as it has in ours.\\n\\nWhile it was nearly impossible to live up to the aroma, the taste did come close to matching it, though it lost some of the added post-grind complexity and was mostly Bubba in profile. One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the \"greasy\" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses — this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn\\'t give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.\\n\\nOne word kept coming up during our reviews of this strain, and that was \"fun\" — this one just really improved our moods almost immediately, making us feel social, extroverted, and creative. It definitely felt Sativa in profile to start, increasing energy and bordering on racy at times (never anxious though), with a heavily buzzing body and pressurized face/eyes. The happy mood and relaxed body which made up the majority of the experience post-30 minutes wasn\\'t conducive to working simply because we wanted to enjoy life more than concentrate on anything. This strain was great for some mind-wandering and following your fancy, so to speak. After the main potency passed around 1.5 hours into the experience, we felt more able to actually relax and concentrate if needed, and the body relaxation feelings increased.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nAlbert Walker is a legendary clone-only Afghani skunk variety, while Manic is also an old-school Afghani, though with a sugary sweet smell.\\xa0 The combination of the two creates a hard-hitting yet very positive Indica hybrid that yields welland exudes a lemon-garlic aroma.\\n\\nAlbert Walker x Manic\\n\\nThis strain was named \"32? (pronounced \"Three-Two\") because that was the number of the \"keeper\" female.\\n\\nPungent mix of lemon, garlic, and body odor funk when ground \\n\\nSpicy and citrusy, with a lingering aftertaste \\n\\nThough it\\'s a strongly Indica-dominant strain, it seems to shift its effects depending upon mood and situation.\\xa0 If it\\'s midday and you\\'re immersed in a physical activity, it\\'ll have you feeling relaxed, happy, and capable — if you\\'re medicating before bed, it\\'ll ease you into restful sleep.\\xa0 Potent effects package all-around; good body relaxation, sleep aid, relief from minor pain, and ocular attention. \\n\\n(info courtesy of Scott, founder of Stone Mountain Wellness) \"BIG yielder, hungry plant needs extra food.\\xa0 Bright orange hair and lemony garlic smell and flavor. \\xa0Great herb for hiking. \\xa0Happy good time all around. 60 days of flower.\"\\n\\nAfghanistan\\n\\nClone-only, very rare\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n60 days\\n\\nSour D x OG Kush x Master Kush\\n\\nSour D x OG Kush x Master Kush\\n\\nNorthern California\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant\\r\\n        \\nThis A.S.H. is an example of some classic genetic lines in perhaps the \"trinity\" of genetic lines, Afghani, Skunk, and Haze. The blend of these influences could be seen in all areas of the sample, from its structure, to its smell, to the effects. We all enjoyed this strain but saw potential for better medicinal-level duration and better flavor lurking within, namely due to what we see as a slightly early harvest and not-quite thorough enough flush. These flaws didn\\'t do much to dampen the overall experience however, and the mix of uplifting and ground effects from the Afghani and Haze parts of this strain were an enjoyable tug-of-war that ultimately felt like a great hybrid. This is a good strain for those who appreciate the classic taste palate of Skunk and Afghani and desire a daytime mix of Sativa and Indica effects — we felt that the strongly cerebral and slightly rushy start would be a little much for inexperienced patients, especially those who suffer from anxiety or nausea issues.\\n\\r\\n            Afghani Skunk x Afghani Haze\\r\\n        \\nBred by Mr. Nice Seedbank\\n\\nClaw-shaped fern green sepals in open, loose calyxes, with driftwood brown pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thin stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nhe staff\\'s consensus favorite part of this sample, the aroma was a very classic-smelling mix of musky, skunky, garlicy, vegetal, and lightly fruity/sweet all at once. The lightly sweet and fruity Afghani musk it broadcasts in the jar is rather pungent, but it increases further when ground and takes on more of the garlic dimension as well, always with the Haze spice in the background.\\n\\nFlavor-wise, this strain was again a mix between the almost putrid, lightly sweet, fruity Afghan and slightly sharper and spicy flavors. We didn\\'t feel that the smell came through to the taste as cleanly as we would have liked, we think this is partly due to the Haze-style bud structure containing a decent amount of leaf cover, which brought added harshness and standard smoke flavor to the party. The thick smoke that results from this one was moderately expansive and did hit the lungs a bit hard, causing some coughing at times. \\n\\nWe felt both parts of the lineage on this one pretty clearly, and it almost seemed to run the gambit of Sativa and Indica even between our review staff, with one member reporting heavily Sativa feelings, one somewhere in-between, and one leaning slightly towards the Indica side. The start was clearly Sativa and Hazy in nature, coming on rather strongly to start, but seemingly building over the first 30-45 minutes, filling our heads with pressure, our chests with a fluttery, light, borderline rushy feeling, and a slight loss of vestibular senses (felt like we were moving or spinning at times, especially with eyes closed). It definitely served to wake us up a bit with the potency, but it also cast a bit of a \"sensory blanket\" feeling over everything, and we just felt a little bit mentally slow despite the internal energy. Still, we were able to function in more creative and less detail-minded tasks, and the relaxation feelings increased as it rolled past 1.5 hours. The Afghani body effects seemed to come into play around the same time, serving to bring us back down after a rather \\'up\\' beginning, but it never really made us drowsy or came with the crash we expected.

Its leaves are so thin they feel like feathers when you brush against them. Though many CBD strains are reserved for concentrates for their overwhelming\\xa0tendency to self-polinate, AC/DC is a proven 30:1 CBD strain that holds well as finished buds and is very stable. \\n\\nCannatonic Phenotype\\n\\nAC/DC is a CBD-rich phenotype of Cannatonic. It has been tested at 30:1 CBD, just above the threshold of industrial hemp. This cut has been circulating through California for several years, and in some ways Charlotte\\'s Web, another \"pure CBD\" strain has somewhat stolen its thunder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot your typical \"Nebraska No-High\" hemp plant, the cured buds are tight formed but fluffy. Very little kush structure and much more akin to skunk variaties with sizeable colas. \\n\\nAC/DC smells like lemongrass and cherries.\\n\\nCherries and berries are evident in a thick, woody smoke. \\n\\nThere are just traceable amounts of THC in AC/DC and is as close to a \"Pure CBD\" whole plant as you can get.

potency and head effects thanks to the Maui Haze father.\\xa0 This blend of two old-school genetics lines produces a sticky, potent plant that stays relatively short throughout its lifespan.\\n\\nAfghani #1 x Maui Haze\\n\\nAppearing first in the California medical scene, this strain has some serious old-school credentials… the original Afghani #1 is a cut grown in California since at least the 1980\\'s that was composed of several landrace Afghani hash-making varieties.\\xa0 As a result, this hybrid picks some Sativa vigor from the Maui Haze, but otherwise displays its Afghani roots — it\\'s a sticky, trichome-laden plant that is known for gumming up a grinder or two.\\n\\nProperly-grown Afgooey will have a deeply sweet and fruity aroma with a background of pine and hash — the most common fruit note picked up is cherry.\\n\\nMostly hashy and/or herby, it sometimes produces a nice berry sweetness (much like the smell, it\\'s a bit unreliable and largely depends on growing skill/technique).\\n\\nWith a relatively strong Indica effects package, Afgooey has the potential to be a \"daywrecker\", but at small-to-average doses, it\\'s squarely in the functional Indica category thanks to the Haze influence.\\xa0 Buzzy, slack extremities, a fuzzy mental state, and a definite couchlock tendency forms the core of the Afgooey experience.\\xa0 It definitely lightens the mood in a goofy, slack-jawed kind of way, but is overall a \"down\" experience that is most conducive to seated activities not requiring a ton of attention.\\xa0 Shows benefits with strong relaxation properties (both mental and physical), mood elevation, sleep aid properties (especially at high dosages), anti-anxiety, ocular relief, and mild pain relief.\\n\\nGrows well in either soil or hydro setups, good for space-sensitive grows as well.\\n\\nAfghanistan/United States\\n\\nClone-only, from California originally\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nMedium, 55-60 days\\n\\nLike a rollercoaster with a big first drop, this one was strong off the bat and then finished out much calmer. We loved the mixed nature of the high, and it felt almost equal in terms of mental and physical effects. The unexpectedly sweet and fruity taste and smell was a great addition to the effects. I\\'d recommend this to almost anyone, as it was balanced and not too strong… and may be our new in-house favorite \"easy indica\".\\n\\r\\n            Afghani IBL\\r\\n        \\nDark green with slight purple hues, nearly invisible brick red pistils. Solid trichome count and large calyxes\\n\\nVery complex and unexpected for a pure Afghani strain… the sweetness and multitude of smells was great. It was hard to describe, but I definitely got some dark fruity/berry notes, especially post-grind when the pungency skyrocketed.\\n\\n Similar to smell, berries that did not earth out like most sweet ones do, more like it hashed out slightly.\\n\\n Instant and extremely clean relaxed feeling but not the intense crushing indica takeover expected. Body went from tight and anxious to loose and calm with a pulsing from top to back of head. Very comfortable and very welcome start. It progresses to a really positive and happy experience, sometimes just causing smiles. Great mix of head and body, strong in both areas. It lets up quite a bit 1.5 hours in, but I was able to cook dinner totally pain-free and it never made me want to just sit around even though the body high was so present and relaxing. \\n\\nKansas\\n\\r\\n            Indica\\r\\n        \\nStrong medication. The buzz really got me stoned and felt very discombobulated. The strong head high followed by a strong body high had me planted on the couch. I wasn\\'t completely drained of energy, and it gave me a great tranquil ending to the buzz. After a long day at work grinding against major back pains, I will go to my stash and definitely fire up the AfPak.\\n\\r\\n            Afghani Landrace x Pakistani Landrace\\r\\n        \\nRock hard nugs that look like a ball of keif. Covered in yellow looking trichomes and compacted with lime green leaves and light orange hairs.\\n\\n Has a thick aroma that is very pungent. Kind of skunky, and smells like my nutrients - a pleasant mix of sweet and earth/pine. Makes me kind of dizzy, in a good way.\\n\\nVery heavy smoke but goes in pretty smooth. Strong hash and earthy taste.\\n\\nGives me a very euphoric high leaving me feeling very happy and a little trippy at the outset. The sativa aspect of this hybrid act early and provide focus and clarity, but give way to a very strong narcotic state and makes it hard to function mentally. Makes my head feel really hot, and makes my shoulders feel real heavy. The indica is very dominant after about 20 minutes, where it induces couchlock and body becomes lethargic. Feels like a great blend of head and body buzz.\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Normally a mix of deep purple and greens, Afro Berry is a very

it has been knocked down a tier in the last few years with all the high-grade Kush and Diesel strains especially. However, this AK-47 x NL-5 was a good reminder that it\\'s a strain to reckon with, as is the even older Northern Lights #5. It\\'s very clear why these strains were chosen as a hybrid – it provided a superb blend of hybrid effects that seemed to satisfy a little bit of everything while maintaining its power throughout the duration. The smell is extremely unique but unfortunately doesn’t always translate to the taste. This old-school blend would make almost anyone happy (literally, it was an instant mood enhancement) and has the potential to help patients greatly with almost any disorder that they may have except for very serious pain.\\n\\nAK-47 x Nothern Lights #5\\n\\nCovered in orange-brown pistils, this strain almost had a yellowish hue to it that made it look less appealing than it actually was from afar.\\xa0 It wasn\\'t exactly covered with tall visible trichs either, so this strain would probably fly a bit under the radar for most people.\\xa0 But upon magnification, its trichome coverage becomes apparent.\\n\\nThis strain unleashed a very unexpected blast of sweetness combined with a cocktail of spices, similar to what one would find in egg nog or mulled wine.\\xa0 A variety of smooth and sweet smells from cinnamon to cardamom was the dominant aroma.\\xa0 When it was ground up, it trended a bit more towards the standard citrus side with a vegetal sweetness, which when combined with the initial smell reminded one reviewer of candied orange peels.\\xa0 Though it won\\'t make you sneeze with its pungency, it was above-average in that regard and could be detected from a few feet away.\\n\\nWith\\xa0 just a hint of the spices that permeated the aroma, this strain tasted mostly of a lightly sweet piney citrus with a bit of hashiness.\\xa0 The taste was a bit ethereal, as it seemed distinct and fairly strong but then disappeared as quickly as it came, leaving us struggling to describe it in detail.\\xa0 This strain gave us an incredibly smooth smoke that upgraded the overall taste score simply because it was such an easy and enjoyable smoke despite expanding quite a bit. \\n\\nImmediately after smokin, our reviewers found themselves in a quickly elevated mood and with a super heavy high behind the eyes that felt like they weighed 5 pounds each.\\xa0 A spacey head and vibrating body were also part of the package, putting our review team in a great mood where they wanted to be as social as possible or pursue creative endeavors.\\xa0 The body high seemed to move mostly to the feet/legs and filled them with a buzzing energy as it went on - our reviewers were pain-free during the review despite doing a variety of activities.\\xa0 This was a fairly superb hybrid high that hit on almost every desirable trait of an MMJ experience, with no anxiety, paranoia, or other negativity.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis is a bud I will go back for again and again.

Seemingly not able to make up its mind, we vacillated between states of energy and sloth, but felt slightly spaced-out the entire time. The one constant was the relaxed and numbing body high, which kept us pain-free and in a good mood. It was above-average in potency, but never got overwhelming, making this a good choice for almost any level of MMJ patient effects-wise.

There is no missing the onslaught of medicine from every angle and most patients will take 5 minutes to gather their bearings.

This is strong medicine.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThough this strain is a sativa, it hits like a ton of bricks and definitely takes after its mother, the head-knocking Original Diesel, an east coast favorite. There are a few different phenotypes of this strain available, but the most popular is the #1, which is the most Diesel-dominant and has reportedly tested at 25%+ THC on several occasions. Biesel is kicking around at several dispensaries throughout Colorado, and it\\'s definitely worth a look for patients who like a more stony and sedative sativa with a complex Diesel bouquet.\\n\\nShark Haze X Sour Diesel\\n\\nIts acrid aroma carries strong skunky elements and an enticing blend of fuel and Haze spice battling for attention in the background.\\xa0Its acrid aroma carries strong skunky elements and an enticing blend of fuel and Haze spice battling for attention in the background.\\n\\nIt has quite potent head effects to start, doing the normal Diesel thing and filling the user\\'s head with pressure and a buzzing sensation, and causing the mind to wander off at the slightest distraction. \\xa0This excited and cerebral initial effect quickly drops into a much more \"blank slate\" feeling, where the mind is really just processing information and the user is not doing much interacting — it\\'s suitable for movies and other passive entertainment, but anything active would probably be a little too much. \\xa0The body effects are a strong muscle relaxation and the tendency to remain seated due to the general comfort level this med provides. \\xa0Strong appetite stimulation and ocular effects signal \"Sativa\", but the overall tenor of the experience is more along the Indica lines past the initial 30-45 minutes.It has quite potent head effects to start, doing the normal Diesel thing and filling the user\\'s head with pressure and a buzzing sensation, and causing the mind to wander off at the slightest distraction. \\xa0This excited and cerebral initial effect quickly drops into a much more \"blank slate\" feeling, where the mind is really just processing information and the user is not doing much interacting — it\\'s suitable for movies and other passive entertainment, but anything active would probably be a little too much. \\xa0The body effects are a strong muscle relaxation and the tendency to remain seated due to the general comfort level this med provides. \\xa0Strong appetite stimulation and ocular effects signal \"Sativa\", but the overall tenor of the experience is more along the Indica lines past the initial 30-45 minutes.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nBig Bud is known to be a weaker strain that many growers use to up the yields of more interesting strains, yet this Big Wreck is very potent.

Lots of ocular pressure fluctuations and a definite spacey mental feeling carried it into its peak stage about 25 minutes in, where a detached and slack-jawed mental state collided with mood elevation and physical energy (but no desire to actually get up and do something with it). Two reviewers moved onto a very \"crushed\" state where it was a struggle to stay awake and functional in the world, while another (smaller dosage) didn\\'t report that feeling. So that leads us to believe that the higher dosage may put this into the crushing category… try it out and see which amount works for your body type and needs.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nGirl Scout Cookies (Forum Cut) x Romulan\\n\\nRomulan x Girl Scout Cookies\\n\\nLike Girl Scout Cookies, a doughy, fresh baked smell is detectable off of well cured flowers.

It has a perfume-like smell that reminded us of fancy soaps, with just a hint of fruity sweetness. The aroma was very enjoyable, but required some coaxing to really come out, and was never all that pungent.\\n\\nThe flavor was more sweet and fruity than the aroma was, with a definite grape element. It wasn\\'t very pungent beyond the first hit or two, but the smoke was smooth and not harsh on the throat. There was moderate expansion though, and multiple reviewers reported some coughing at the end of the review portion as the smoke became very thick.\\n\\nThis strain came on quickly, after 2 or 3 hits it sent a wave of pressure into the eyes and head, and a buzzing sensation in the feet and shoulders. A calming sensation came over our staff, putting the mind at ease, but making us a little slow-witted. It was more suited to stationary activities like watching a movie or (if you can keep your eyes open) reading a book, and we didn\\'t feel the desire to leave the house at all. The effect got somewhat tiring as it progressed, with strong muscle relaxation and heavy eyelids making it easy to go curl up for a nap. It was a smooth decline in effect, but multiple reviewers ended up falling asleep before the effects were completely gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnknown\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n45-50 Days\\n\\nPurple Pheno of Chupacabra, Golden Goat female x Stardawg male\\n\\nGolden Goat x Stardawg\\n\\nAn exclusive breeding project of Green Dream Cannabis in Boulder, the Golden Goat female can be found in the garden in production and on the shelves.

It\\'s definitely a berry-scented strain, but that didn\\'t translate to the taste. Still, the pleasant smoking experience again made up for that shortcoming, making this a perfect selection for patients who need an Indica but don\\'t like the thick, at times cholorophyl-laden (since they generally have more leaf matter) smoke they deliver… \"pleasant\" was the word that kept coming to mind with this one.\\n\\r\\n            DJ Short\\'s Blueberry x Afghani\\r\\n        \\n Though the lineage would suggest a more dense structure than the result shows here, we liked the foxtailed and unpredictable structure. Light green and looking like the DJ Short\\'s Blueberry side of the family, it has brick red pistils and a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. \\n\\n This sample reminded us both of a purple strain and Blueberry with its slightly musky but sweet berry aroma — we did indeed pick up a Blackberry element to the smell as well. It was more piney and musky pre-grind, but sweetened up quite a bit and got more pungent once handled.\\n\\nLightly sweet and spicy in the mouth, this strain didn\\'t have a ton of taste to it. The smoke was incredibly smooth and non-expansive though, making this a superb choice for those who don\\'t want to cough.\\xa0\\n\\n With only a little ear tickle and some face/head pressure to start, this one came on rather slowly and built into a uniquely relaxing body-centric experience within 45 minutes. With a lot of downward inertia serving to pull us into the couch, the warming and relaxing body effects came with very little mental effect other than a pleasant sense of relaxation (mental processes were clear). As time moved slowly forward, the numbing and tingly body effects kept up at a high level, especially in the hands and arms. One effect that we all noticed was strong relief of stomach issues and increase in appetite, which came on almost immediately. As it subsided, we were generally a little tired and this med would definitely pave the way for a restful night of sleep. \\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis strain was hailed as one of the \"next big things\" in 2008 by High Times, but never really seemed to catch on to the level that many expected.

It\\'s a very strange and unique taste that you really only find in Cheese strains — alternately appealing and revolting, like many fine cheeses \\n\\n The taste took on more of the cheese elements than the smell did, while the berry sweetness fell to the background. One reviewer commented that there was even an iron/mineral-like taste, similar to what is found in very \"goaty\" cheeses, while others mainly picked up on peppery, sharp notes. The sweetness was still present, but the sharp tastes were stronger for sure.\\xa0\\n\\nWe had one outlier reviewer in our results that had a very uppy, motivational experience full of energy, exaggerated hand motions, and laughter… this contrasted with the experiences of the other reviewers yet was repeated on a secondary review, so we felt it worth mentioning. Sometimes meds simply affect people differently, so keep that in mind with this one, as we don\\'t normally have one review sticking out so much from the others.The majority of staff felt that this was a wonderful relaxing med that served to take all the troubles and pains of the day and put the brakes on them. Starting off with a buzzing, warm body, strong forehead/temple pressure, and an immediate mood elevation, this strain felt really potent early on. It was a torquey med that stayed at medicinal levels for around 1.5 hours, only tailing off around hour 2. The dominant state was one of engaged but inactive focus, where the couch and a movie or video games were the perfect accompaniment. It was a great \"stealth med\" though, as the reviewer\\'s physical appearance was unaffected despite the potency. A soft drop (or perhaps a rise, since it was a \"down\" med overall) back to sobriety made this a smooth experience overall.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n8-9 Weeks\\n\\nThough it wasn\\'t one of the craziest-looking or strongest-tasting samples we\\'ve had as of late, this was a very solid med that would earn a place in our Indica rotation thanks to its enduring calming effects and even-handed power. It was never giving us anything unexpected and provided a steadily Indica-dominant experience that was effective enough while not being pushy. The grow quality overall was superb, with only a few small flaws to speak of, none of which seemed to affect the final quality all that much. A very solid in -house creation from The Health Depot here… and we have to say that the name is very appropriate considering the smell!\\n\\r\\n            DJ Short\\'s Blueberry x AK-47\\r\\n        \\nBred by The Health Depot in Colorado\\n\\n It seems as if the AK-47 has bulked up the trichome count on the Blueberry, as this sample arrived caked with cloudy-headed trichomes, alongside a healthy blend of light greens, and mixed autumn-colored pistils.\\n\\nThe DJ Short\\'s Blueberry really comes through here — notes of blueberries, strawberries, mint ice cream, and a slight sour element that comes out after the grind. If you like a sweet, fruity strain, this one\\'s right up your alley. It\\'s very nicely pungent as well, one of the stronger-smelling fruit varieties we\\'ve had in some time.\\n\\nWhile not quite as pungent and overwhelmingly sweet as the smell, the taste still had a clear berry flavor with hints of earth, flowers, and vegetation. It wasn\\'t a particularly enduring or pungent taste, but was enjoyed by the staff. The staff unanimously agreed that the smoke was very smooth and not too expansive, making this a good choice for patients who don\\'t wish to cough or otherwise have respiratory issues. The final ash was a little iffy-looking, with a charcoal/gray mix, indicating that it may have needed a more thorough flush.\\n\\nA rush of heat to the face and eyes started things off, with an accompanying relaxation and warmth coming over the body as well. The eyes and cheeks especially felt the effects of this medicine, though it didn\\'t seem to physically affect them, as they were mostly clear and wide open. It showed some mood elevation properties in our review staff but was not euphoric by any means — it seemed to be a measured positivity that depended a bit on the incoming mood. The dominant feeling on this med was that of worry-free relaxation with a definite couchlock/lazy quality to it. This would be a good choice for a lazy day or an evening, though it wasn\\'t so strong and lethargic to make it tough for daytime/busy use… we could focus when necessary.\\n\\r\\n            Colorado\\r\\n        \\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            DJ Short\\'s Blueberry x NYC Diesel\\r\\n        \\nBred by Sanni at Breeder\\'s Choice GeneticsBred by Sanni at Breeder\\'s Choice Genetics\\n\\nCream to burnt orange pistils, average coverage with small-headed trichomes over green calyxes tinged with purple edges\\n\\nArtificial blue sweetener - cotton candy or melted sugar.

This was our first experience with Blue Kush and we all found it to be extremely enjoyable, exotic, and something we\\'d all happily go out and buy. The appearance, smell, and taste were like the two strains were combined in a lab — perfect fusion of sweet fruitiness and Kush spiciness and elements of each strain\\'s structure. We found this strain to be very relaxing and medicinal without being overbearing or sending us into a withdrawn, sleepy state like many Indicas can do. Perfect daytime (or evening really) Indica relief, though complicated tasks might rub you the wrong way when you really just want to enjoy the strain\\'s comforting body effects.\\n\\r\\n            Blueberry x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\nBred by Dinafem Seeds\\n\\nArrowhead-shaped cucumber sepals with seaweed green accents, tight clustered calyxes, with cumin-colored pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thick-stalked trichomes with average heads\\n\\nThe fusion of Blue and Kush stood out in the aroma, with the pre-grind smell presenting more of a piney Kush quality, while the post-grind smell unleashed a wonderful sweet and sour berry. This one seemed to change almost at random — you smell it one moment and it\\'s all sweet berry, but the next it has clear Kush spice notes — this is a complex and engaging strain with a great pungency level.\\n\\nThough it was less pungent and more ethereal than the aroma, the taste was much the same and continued the perfect match of Blue and Kush. We again noticed that the flavor seemed to shift and mutate as we burned away the sample, at times being sweet berry, at times sour berry, and sometimes all Kushy spice. We all enjoyed how the flavor changed and the overall complexity, as well as the endurance.\\n\\nThe effects built smoothly over the initial 5 minutes or so, resulting in a mentally alert yet strongly medicated state where the body felt very relaxed and warm. We kept calling this one \"expansive\", as it seemed to improve our mood as well as gave us a floaty, pulsing body that felt as it was growing from within. Social and positive, we were reaching out for company but kept gravitating towards more relaxing and less-technical activities that allowed time for contemplation and respite. This even-handed and smooth state continued at a high level for a full 2 hours, which is a longer medicinal-level staying power than most — the effect declined rather quickly at approximately 2.5 hours and lingered out to 3.\\n\\nSpain\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n55-62 Days\\n\\nSaid best by one of our reviewers, \"I\\'m not usually one for meds that close off the outside world, but this Blue Widow was damn nice.

It tasted much like the smell with a sweet berry tone that was very pleasing.\\n\\nThe Blue Widow makes no bones about its indica nature and immediately delivers a calming wave. Pressure and stress melt away leaving the mind in a comfortable solitude and the body in a flacid state. Conversation and outside intrusion (TV/Radio/Computer) were found to be somewhat unpleasant but still performable if necessary. The couch and a book, or a towel and the sun, are where your mind and body will want to park and enjoy the long, relaxing ride.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nBlueberry [Thai Sativa (Oregon Purple & Juicy Fruit) x Afghan Indica]\\n\\nPretty stereotypical Blueberry — bright calyxes, dark green leaves, and orange pistils. Average in almost every sense, it was dense enough to be substantial, dry enough to burn well, and covered in a moderately dense layer of trichs.\\xa0\\n\\nYep, this is Blueberry… this sample had that perfect sugar-coated muffin smell and was rather pungent both pre and post-grind. After the grind, a slightly musky and putrid sweetness came out, taking over for some of the sugary berry. Simply put, if you like Blueberry, you\\'ll love this smell.\\n\\nA tad disappointing after the sugary bouquet, the taste was a little more subdued, with only one reviewer getting the beautiful candy berry/muffin type taste out of it. It seems to be in there, but coaxing it out wasn\\'t easy for everyone… there was an earthy element to it as well that came out in later hits. Rather smooth and not particularly expansive, this one was an easy smoke.\\n\\nA very smooth and linear experience overall, this strain started off with some light Sativa effects such as eye/face/temple pressure fluctuations, but also immediate relief in the neck and shoulder blade area. With elevated moods, this med took us on a relaxing ride that left us feeling capable the entire time and never overly medicated or fuzzy. While it was more prone to sitting activities, the muscle relaxation and pain relief made active ones enjoyable as well. A strangely enduring face feeling persisted well into the 2nd hour, and the eyes seemed to get redder as the experience went along rather than vice-versa, as is normally the case.\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nOne of the most unique-looking plants we\\'ve had the pleasure of photographing here at PotGuide, \"the Bob\" (as it\\'s also known) is a freak confluence of quality genetics which produced a plant which is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. Combining the signature Hanis nail polish/acetone-meets-chocolate aroma and flavor with the Sativa growth pattern and yield of the S.A.G.E., Bob Saget is extremely resinous and has almost no leaf aside from the actual fan leaves. The effects are uplifting and borderline racy at first, but mellow out slightly into a lightly psychedelic, but still buzzy experience, before crashing out at the end as many strong sativas do.\\nBob Saget is great for very mind-engaging activities such as creative tasks or video games (easy to get \"in the zone\" with either one) but not quite as great for conversations, as the mind-racing going on inside the head often overrides the conversation with others. As it winds down, the mind becomes a little slower and a soft cloudiness sets in, while the body also seems to relax from the near-frenzy of activity which constitutes the first hour of effects.\\n\\nFt. Collins (\"FoCo\") S.A.G.E. (Big Sur Holy x Afghani) x Hanis (Kunduz Afghani purple pheno x [Pre-\\'98 Bubba Kush x 1994 Positronics Haze])\\n\\nThis strain was created by master breeder Tierra Rojo (of New House Seeds) during the summer of 2010. \\xa0The Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. mother is a very Sativa-leaning phenotype of that strain, finishing around 11-12 weeks and producing massive, bract-stacking colas — that cut was intentionally pollinated in early flowering by a Hanis plant which threw a couple of male flowers after being stressed late in flower due to hard flushing. \\xa0The resulting pollen only managed to produce a scant 6 seeds in the S.A.G.E. mother, only one of which was planted. \\xa0The rest of the seeds from this original cross have been lost to history, but the spectacular seed that was planted has hung around in clone form, being held tightly by a very select few in the Colorado area. \\xa0The name of the strain came from a sloppily-written plant tag which appeared to read \"SAGET\" rather than \"SAGE x\" and just stuck because everyone thought it was funny.\\n\\nBob Saget is an almost otherworldly-looking plant, taking strongly after both the 1994 Positronics Haze and the Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. with its large bracts and lack of leaf coverage — it often grows in stacking columns of bracts with an outstanding coating of trichomes, which appear to grow in cornrow-like formations, often fitting together much like the teeth of a zipper. \\xa0The plant is normally a greyish green color, but takes on tones of the Hanis\\' rich purple as it finishes, at times coming out almost entirely purple-gray in color thanks to the trichome coverage. \\xa0What little leaf matter is present on The Bob is practically shrouded in trichomes, including the undersides of leaf surfaces, which are featured in the photo album above.\\n\\nPerhaps the Bob Saget\\'s most signature trait, the aroma certainly takes most strongly after the Hanis \"father\" plant, blending a complex, sharp chemical scent which almost resembles acetone with a slight sweetness. \\xa0The initial inhale tends to bring more of the sweetness, but as the buds are broken apart, the acrid paint thinner side comes out very strongly, tingling the nose like few strains can. \\xa0The Bob (like Hanis) is almost not recognizable as cannabis scent-wise because it is so strange and unique.\\n\\nMuch like the aroma, the flavor at first has hints of sweetness and a unique floral element, but the aftertaste which lingers on the palate and in the throat (similar to Bubba Kush or Flo) is all Hanis superglue-chocolate funk.\\n\\nBob is an interesting Sativa in that it has such a strong Indica influence genetically, but the plant itself is extremely Sativa in growth pattern. \\xa0This dichotomy shows in the effects, which start off very Hazy, cerebral, visual, and energetic, and then covert into a stoney, sedate, mind-wandering state that borders upon a \"crash\" later in the duration. \\xa0Bob is one of those strains that you can smoke again an hour later and get right back to where you were, and the ceiling is rather high as well, with little tolerance buildup due to regular use. \\xa0Due to the relaxing second half, it\\'s normally best as an early evening strain, though smoking on it all day will keep the user\\'s mind active and stave off the typical Sativa crash which often comes as the 2nd hour of effects approaches.\\n\\nBob flourishes in coco coir with a well-aerated mix (coco-perlite sandwiches, for example) and relatively heavy feeding. \\xa0The plant stretches a fair amount when kicked into flower, but isn\\'t one that will get so tall it falls over under its own weight or anything. \\xa0SCROG or similar training is recommended to maximize yield, and heavy feedings early will set a solid foundation for lots of bract growth and a more dense structure. \\xa0Moderate to light organic feeding normally results in a fairly airy plant, but one with an incredible aroma and flavor, as well as some of the largest individual bracts you will see on cannabis.\\n\\nDenver, Colorado, USA\\n\\nClone-only, one-off creation by Tierra Rojo\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n9-10 weeks, depending on effect desired\\n\\nAs with many of the high-THC% samples we\\'ve had, it seems that the potency mostly translates into a longer duration rather than a \"woah!\" type of experience to start — this Bogglegum carried on for a very long time (especially at higher doses) and held its potency at an above-average level for quite a while. If the peak potency were a little higher, it would\\'ve been an easy A, but it just didn\\'t grab all of our review staff with its effects, which were mostly just base relaxation and a slight uptick in cerebral activity. The grow was nearly flawless, the sample was rather beautiful, the smell and taste both were above-average and enjoyable… it was just one of those strains that might never get into the upper-echelon of modern medical cannabis, as this seems to be pretty much its genetic potential. Try it out if you like a fairly functional Indica with a sweet soil taste that holds its potency for a long time — it\\'s recommended most for intermediate patients.\\n\\r\\n            BOGBubble x Northern Lights #5\\r\\n        \\nBred by Bushy Old Grower (aka BOG)\\n\\nThis Bogglegum was totally loaded with fat-headed trichomes that seemed to hit just about perfect harvest timing, with plenty of visible ambers. The frosty appearance made the buds look almost white in the hand, broken up by occasional darker green leaves and red/orange/yellow pistils.\\n\\nA sugary, slightly creamy sweetness is the main bag/jar smell, and we can definitely see where the bubble gum comes into play. After grinding, a most robust and musky smell comes out, with notes of soil, earth, and vegetation overtaking the sweetness for the most part. It was an average pungency sample, neither stinking up the room nor going unnoticed.\\n\\nTwo reviewers struggled a bit to get a good taste read on this sample, but the one who seemed to get the most picked up on a taste that was very much similar to the smell, namely a soil-dominant attack, followed by a sugary, floral, sweet quality that lingered on the tongue and in the throat. Though the taste was great, it was a bit elusive — still, the smoke was extremely smooth yet expansive.\\n\\nThis was a fairly cerebral Indica, keeping us mentally aware the entire time despite being rather strong overall and flirting with overwhelming feelings at its peak. Concentration on only one subject was difficult at times, but our thought processes were clear and vivid throughout the experience. The initial onset came on heavy, with a warming sensation throughout the body and head/eyes and a buzzing headband-like feeling — we all thought our eyes would be red and low, but they were relatively open and clear… good \"stealth\" med. The Bogglegum seemed to have a mood stabilization effect with us, keeping the mindstate even-handed and calm. The body relaxation carried on well into the latter part of the duration, and overall this med held onto its potency better than most, lingering into hour #3.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            An Indica-dominant hybrid that is comprised of some special and rare genetics, Bordello is known for turning wonderful colors (likely due to the Soma\\'s Lavender part of the equation) and packing quite a punch, both in flavor and potency.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Blackberry Apocalypse x TRC Alexis F2 pollen (Blackberry Apocalypse is Tony (*bagseed clone) x Blackberry from Memy\\'s Finest Seeds, while Alexis is Sweet tooth #3 x Lavender)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Originally created by \"Lonestar\", the founder of Texas Resin Company.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sweet (on the berry side of things) and slightly skunky \\n\\r\\n            Depends on pheno, but generally it\\'s slightly sweet and herby \\n\\r\\n            Though it\\'s heavily Indica in its makeup, Bordello tends to be relatively light overall, never feeling overwhelming or bleary-eyed.\\xa0 It has a very solid body relaxation component, but keeps the mind relatively clear and functional.\\xa0 It tends to have rather strong ocular effects as well, making it a good choice for glaucoma, etc. \\n\\r\\n            Texas, USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Texas Resin Company (original breeder: \"Lonestar\")\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            About 7 weeks\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sour Diesel x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\nThis phenotype of OG Kush is believed to originate in the early 1990s in Southern California.

That was around 2000/2001 at cw. he was touting it, showing fat stacks of cash, his grows, etc. As far as we\\'ve been told, he sold a cut of Bubba to GCM and GCM sold it to Katsu. That is the Katsu cut, aka, orgnkid\\'s green phenotype. Orgnkid first obtained this Bubba around 2000/2001 and got the OG slightly thereafter. Mint Bubba S1- ECK06\\'s s1 phenotype from the first batch of Bubba Kush s1\\'s orgnkid posted to the bay. Purple Bubba S1 - This is a cut orgnkid scored from a SFV club owner that was an s1 of the original Bubba cut the owner of the club sourced (whichever that is). The club owner was scared of the dudes he got it from and knew not to break their rules. But there was a way around it so he could make cuts and buds available to his club. So he makes some s1 seeds from the Bubba, pulls out the yielding, club nugget purple Bubba pheno. Now he has an \"unheld\" cut of the Bubba. THE REAL PRE-98/PRE2K1 - in 2004/5 or so we obtained the above purple and green bubbas from orgnkid through a mutual friend. We also got a cutting from our good friend in norcal (the true pre98).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the sake of everyone online that had different cuts back then, we put some info in a Bubba thread much like this one where we grew all three of them side by side and compared. We labeled the orgnkid/katsu the GREEN PHENO/2k1. We labeled the ClubS1 the PURPLE PHENO/2k1. And we labeled the Norcal one, pre2k1, because at that time, we hadn\\'t asked our buddy ALL the info on the norcal cut.. And we were told orgnkid\\'s were obtained in 2k1. So anyways, after a few more pages in that thread at CW, people started getting the pre98 moniker from the kalimist mixed up with the pre2k1 bubba designation. So after probing our friend, he told us he got it from a glassblower in socal around 1998. After posting that, the pre2k1 pretty much started getting called the pre98. The pre-98 is shabud\\'s cut. Swerve\\'s Pre-98 - We don\\'t know where swerve obtained this cut, you would have to ask him. But he has told us that he termed his \"pre98\" because the cut he obtained, reminded him of the the Bubba he was smoking in 1998-2000 in SFV.\\n\\nVery thick flowers ranging from dark black and purple to green depending on the \"cut\" of this strain. \\xa0Remaining constant, Bubba produces Kush style cannabis flowers leaning from golf balls to swollen hearts in shape.\\n\\nThe aroma of Bubba Kush is one of those unique scents you will never forget.

The grow quality was very high, with no visible flaws aside from the loose manicure, a great selection of colors, and plenty of well-timed trichomes. While we didn\\'t like the super-sharp smell and taste quite as much as we do the more standard Bubba, it was certainly unique and served to mark this S1 variant as distinct from its parent. If you\\'re a fan of Bubbas, be sure to give this one a try, both because it provides many of the qualities you know and love, but also because it adds something a little different to the equation.\\n\\r\\n            Bubba Kush x Bubba Kush (reversed) [FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED - SEE \"Bubba Kush\" RECORD]\\r\\n        \\nThe Bubba Kush has been released in self-pollinated, feminized form by multiple seed breeders, including Cali Connection and Riot Seeds.\\n\\nblend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, but it had a sort of primordial, prehistoric look blend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, with big, dark water leaves giving a primordial, prehistoric look to the flower. Trichome coverage is above average, on long average width stems with extremely large heads.\\n\\nThough not exactly appealing in the sense that we want our houses to smell like it, this Bubba was certainly impressive and pungent. It gave off a very strong acrid smell that reminded us of other Bubbas at times, but that classic scent stayed more in the background… the main smells reminded us of a tire shop, fuel, glue, and musk, all very acrid once it was ground or broken up. Pre-grind it was more classic Bubba, with the dark almost coffee-like notes… those nearly disappeared once it was handled.\\n\\nThe taste was rather complex, seemingly changing as it cycled through the mouth. Initially it had the sharp rubber + fuel taste from the smell, then once in the mouth it turned sweeter and had more of the traditional Kush notes (spice, citrus)… the finish was spicy, citrus-tinged Kush. The smoke was smooth on the attack but very expansive, so it may cause coughing on bigger hits. The final ash was a speckled very light gray, showing it had a very solid flush before being cut.\\n\\nOur overall experience with this Bubba was one of mental clarity and heavy relaxation. Kushes are known for their mentally-clear effects, and this one was no exception, as we felt completely capable and able to focus despite the Bubba trying to pull us into the couch. The initial effects were an immediate buzzing warmth throughout the body, with a strange relaxed energy and a heavy forehead/eye presence, which felt as if it were hanging over the brow and more weighty than normal. The early effects also came with a rush of thoughts and some visual alterations… in all, a potent start that had one reviewer forgetting about the rest of the bowl. After those early effects died down, a pervading sense of relaxation came over us… there was some couchlock, but overall it wasn\\'t pushy or overwhelming. The comedown had us feeling a bit tired and ready for sleep.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n56-63 Days\\n\\nOne of the more lastingly potent strains to appear early in the Colorado medical marijuana scene, with a torquey power that continued through almost 2 hours after a 15 minute \"creeper\" delay.

An unknown male (possibly Swerve\\'s SFV OG Kush F3 which he used for many breeding projects) was used in this double backcross, first pollinating on the mother to create seed, then another male from that population going back to the Bubba mother once more to reinforce her traits. The resulting plant grows much like the Bubba mom, but some variation in structure (some phenotypes will have long, slender nugs which is unusual for Bubba) is to be expected. However, the majority of nugs are the stereotypical Bubba pine cone/golf ball shape with large calyxes and that signature purple-gray coloration coming on as harvest approaches.\\n\\nPre-\\'98 Bubba Kush BX2\\n\\nSwerve planned this as his 2010 Indica entry for the Amsterdam Cup but was not able to get the nugs ready in time for the festival, so he simply did a special seed release instead.\\n\\nDeep coloration that looks almost gray from a distance is this strain\\'s trademark, and the deep Bubba roots are seen clearly in all aspects of appearance other than the more slender, elongated nug shape which appears in certain phenotypes. \\xa0Trichome coverage is excellent, and it appears that this strain would make some high-yielding and quality extracts, judging from the copious amount of trichomes all over the leaf surfaces.\\n\\nA creamy, slightly sweet coffee-kissed aroma with a herby edge is the primary one while the strain sits undisturbed in a bag or jar. \\xa0However, when it\\'s ground up, the coffee/chocolate comes out a lot more, as does the musky, herby, hashy backnote which recalls the strain\\'s deeply Afghani/Pakistani origins.\\n\\nLosing some of the sweet qualities from the aroma, the flavor is mostly musky and hashy, with a lingering note of coffee. \\xa0Its smoke is moderately thick and moderately expansive, neither sending the patient into coughing fits nor hitting the throat without impact.\\n\\nTaking a few minutes to really kick in, the effects felt predominantly Indica in nature, providing a warming body sensation and pulsing waves which radiated throughout the lower extremities, arms, and torso. \\xa0A slowdown of mental activity accompanied by an overall feeling of ease and contentedness overtakes the user after about 15 minutes, leading to a placid, happy, experience that\\'s very smooth in nature. \\xa0The eyes get slightly heavy at times (even early on), but the effect never really becomes a \"daywrecker\" to the point where it makes the user fall asleep when they wouldn\\'t otherwise or makes the mind cloudy to the point of losing functionality. \\xa0Bubba BX2 helps with both mental and physical relaxation, specifically muscles, but it does so without clouding the mind. \\xa0It also aids with minor pain relief, appetite stimulation, and has definite anti-anxiety properties. \\xa0Medicinal-level effects last around 1.5 to 2 hours, while the overall effects linger out to nearly 3 hours.\\n\\nProduction growers will find that this strain can produce reasonably well in hydro and coco setups. \\xa0However, the best flavor normally comes out in a soil grow using light fertilization regimes — the old-school feeding preferences of the original Bubba are intact here, and that means steady but relatively light feedings. \\xa0If a better yield is desired, the plants can be effectively SCROG\\'d, producing a collection of fairly large rock-hard pine cone tops instead of a slightly larger central cola.\\n\\nCalifornia, USA\\n\\nCali Connection seed release\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n8 to 9 weeks\\n\\nBay Platinum Cookies x Grand Daddy Purple (GDP)\\n\\nThis strain was created by Grand Daddy Purp’s Breeding and Development Team out of California. Candyland is a mix of Bay Platinum Cookies and Grand Daddy Purple – two renowned California strains. The mother, Bay Platinum Cookies, is a sativa dominant Cookies cross also created by Grand Daddy Purp genetics. The father is Ken’s proven Grand Daddy Purple male. Candyland can be cultivated both indoors and outdoors. This strain won a gold medal at the 2012 KushCon. The strain is most popular in California and Colorado.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCandyland produces tight, dense buds – generally circular in shape but depends on phenotype. The color ranges from shades of green to nearly 100% purple. Buds are coated in beautiful orange hairs and trichomes. The plant itself can be stretchy and viney like many Cookies cuts or short and bushy like the Grand Daddy Purple father.\\n\\nDepending on the phenotype, the smell can range from sweet candy and grapes, to earthy, chemy and fuely – or somewhere in between. The Grand Daddy Purple father is famous for passing along its pronounced grape and berry aromas. The Bay Platinum Cookies mother is known to have that classic Girl Scout Cookies aroma with an added bit of sweetness from the Bay 11.\\n\\nBecause this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Candyland generally has a sweet, musky, fuely smell. It is also known to have earthy undertones. Those growing from seed will have the option to choose their preferred flavor profile – some will lean more towards the Cookies and other will be closer to the Grand Daddy Purple.\\n\\nCandyland is known as a mood enhancer that is good for pain relief, managing muscle tension, and relaxation. The high can be more balanced like a hybrid or more sativa dominant depending on phenotype. Although it can be sativa dominant, it is not known to be racy. With THC levels reaching 19%+, the strain can be very potent. Candyland induces feelings of mental focus while providing relief throughout the body. This strain can be effective in treating depression, pain, anxiety, and ADD.\\n\\nCalifornia based genetics (Bay Area)\\nBreeder: Grand Daddy Purp (Ken Estes)\\n\\nThis strain is available in both seed and clone form.\\n\\r\\n             Sativa dominant hybrid – according to the breeder, the strain should be approximately 75% sativa and 25% indica. \\r\\n        \\n8-9+ weeks (56-63+ days)\\n\\nIt never was overtly potent and despite lasting a long time, we sort of lost track of the effects at times because they were mild and unobtrusive. In many senses, this is a good thing (this was a pretty clear-headed med suitable for a day of work), but we think that this one is best saved for newer patients and those seeing moderate relief which last a long time but doesn\\'t ever feel pushy.\\n\\r\\n            Snowcap x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\nSlender spearhead-shaped wasabi green sepals, tightly opened pinecone calyxes, with frequent bursts of saddle brown pisitls, and above average coverage with average-length, thick-stalked hooked trichomes with average heads\\n\\nWhile the aroma wasn\\'t particularly pungent, it did develop a bit when ground up, releasing a crisp, clean, sweet pine-citrus aroma that definitely brought to mind Snowcap and other similar strains (NL #5-Haze, Jack Herer, etc.).\\n\\nSoftly sweet and piney, the flavor was fairly similar to the aroma on the first few hits, but declined from there and just because neutral and smokey. It never really tasted bad, but the flavor just disappeared rather quickly — we think that the dryness level may have had a lot to do with the way the flavor declined, as well as the way the smoke tickled the throat. The flush certainly wasn\\'t to blame for any harshness, because the final ash was mostly white with some black flecks, showing a very quality flush prior to harvest. This one ultimately just fell short of its potential.\\n\\nA moderate pulsing throughout the body and limbs was the signal that effects had begun, coming on rather smoothly and creeping up in potency over the first 20-30 minutes. While we didn\\'t really feel much of a change in mental energy or mood, but rather a gentle relaxation which had us able to concentrate on non-interactive activities, but fading out a bit when deep concentration and attention was required. Several members of the staff commented that this med was almost invisible at times throughout the experience — it\\'s certainly not a \"punch in the face\" type of med, but rather a smooth Sativa that kept us between mood elevation and relaxation with no negative effects or abrupt comedown. Some staff were left wanting more peak potency, but the duration was very good, lingering out to over 3 hours for all of our staff.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThere are two or three versions of Cat Piss.

It is actually R5, a sister seed from the same project with the exact same parents. Almost an identical twin, R5 has a very similar growth pattern and cannabinoid spectrum to R4.

Not all of the staff were quite as enthusiastic about the flavor and smell, but the effects were universally enjoyed for their energetic uplift that only had a tiny edge of anxiety to it early on — great balance of energy and comfort. This was a thoroughly enjoyable medicine, and we felt that it fits best for the daytime, especially a day off when you can really appreciate and indulge in its mind-expanding and mood-elevating effects. One reviewer commented that this was as much a recreational \"fun\" med as a medical one, while another got great relief from back problems and nausea, so it seems to show a versatile nature.\\n\\r\\n            ChemDawg #4 x Sour Diesel\\r\\n        \\nSpearhead-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in clustered stacked calyxes, with bursts of dark burgundy pisitls, and supremely covered with above average-length, average-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nPungency was the name of the game here, and this sample was easily-noticed, whether it was sealed in a bag or not. The dank rubber-fuel-skunk front notes has a background of spice and citrus, making for an almost overwhelming scent package before it\\'s even ground up. The post-grind aroma brought to mind a bit more of the Sour Diesel, with a stronger kick of fresh citrus and an almost floral quality once it settled. This strain is one of those that is a matter of personal preference — most of our crew loved it, but it is a challenging scent like most Chem and Diesel strains.\\n\\nThe pungent aroma translated directly to the flavor, which again was Chem-dominant, with a Sour Diesel-influenced citrusy finish. Deeply spicy with notes of rubber, skunk, and chemical cleaner on the inhale, the exhale left an almost anise-like flavor on the lips, and a fuely scent in the nostrils. Again, this whole family of strains are a bit of an acquired taste, but Chem and Diesel-lovers will certainly appreciate this example\\'s flavor. \\n\\nWhite this strain\\'s effects were felt immediately with the increase in face/eye/head pressure and temperature as well as heart rate, we all felt that it was at its peak between 30 minutes and 1 hour into the experience. The time of day seemed to affect the results of the reviews, as the reviewer who sampled the strain at night felt it shift gears around the 1 hour point to a meditative relaxation, while the daytime reviewers got a lasting boost in energy, mood, and physical activity. The surging energy was felt throughout the body and kept us up on our feet, at times pacing around smiling for no reason in particular. It wound down for most of the staff around the 2 - 2.5 hour mark , but left a lasting feeling of energy and focus, unlike some Sativas which give a drained, \"crash\" feeling as they fade out… a worthy ending to an overall very satisfying experience.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis strain will certainly leave an impression with you… whether it\\'s something you\\'ll come back to is entirely personal preference, because it\\'s definitely not for everyone. Patients who suffer from anxiety, cardiac issues, or cannot handle extremely potent Sativa effects to start may want to steer clear of this one, because it\\'s not to be trifled with. The aroma and appearance both were outstanding, and the flavor was very solid as well — again, the olfactory qualities are an acquired taste, but Diesel and Chem-heads will absolutely love it. while we found some medicinal qualities in this strain (primarily ocular effects and pain distraction due to sheer potency), this one felt like more of a cerebral mind-expander type of strain than anything; truly one for the Sativa-lover who wants to experience raw power.\\n\\r\\n            Chem D x Sour Diesel\\r\\n        \\nLikely bred by Colorado Alternative Medicine in Denver, CO\\n\\nWide spade-shaped clover green sepals arranged in clustered spiral calyxes, snaked through by shocks of mahogany pisitls, and supremely covered with average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nIf aromatic pungency is what you\\'re looking for, this is a great choice. Even from 5 feet away in a sealed baggie, this sample could be smelled, and when it was broken up, it somehow even got more pungent, to the point where it was almost a nose overload and we could only smell it for short bursts. The combination of skunky fuel, gun oil, rubber, hints of citrus, and garlic is something to behold, and really should impress anyone — the catch is whether or not you actually like this acrid and powerful of a scent, which is entirely personal preference.\\n\\nThe sour and somehow sweet combination of fuel, chemical pine, citrus, and spice in this one was amazingly tasty on the early hits, leaving a strong lingering flavor in the mouth and sinuses. Beyond those early hits, it was a fuel-spice lingering flavor which never took on negative qualities. It\\'s worth noting that one reviewer reported the qualities of this strain his mouth and sinuses for up to 40 minutes after smoking — it definitely stays with you.\\n\\nEarly potency is this strain\\'s calling card, and it absolutely jumped all over us to start, feeling almost like a high-grade extract rather than a strain. Our eyes felt like they were bulging, the forehead felt as it was expanding laterally and outwards, and our entire bodies filled with a fluttery, borderline frantic energy (major increase in heart rate). The energy translated to the mental state as well, which would be a flurry of random thoughts and sensory impressions, but then would seem to blank out, where we\\'d get lost staring at a random object, etc. Very potent start with this one, and even up to 1 hour we felt it was still almost at its peak effects (all reviewers were 8.75+ in potency rating at that point, very unusual). It was almost disorienting, and we found ourselves 90% immobile despite the frenetic internal energy. Music was something that we all seemed to enjoy at a high level whole reviewing this sample — the mind was expanded and ready to intake a variety of stimuli, but somehow unsure what to do with it all, making it more like pure sensory input with very little back-end processing. Beyond 1 hour, it began to unleash its grip and we were more able to focus on one thing at a time and the at times anxious mood calmed down.

That said, the potency may simply be too much for many patients, especially those who are prone to anxiety due to some physical manifestations of this sample such as a racing heart and sweating. Even for our experienced staff, we found ourselves bordering on disoriented and unable to do much of anything for the first hour. The power held within the effects were certainly hinted at with the smell and taste, which were both very pungent and acrid — Diesel and ChemDawg connoisseurs will love the bag appeal of this one.\\n\\r\\n            ChemDog x Bio-Diesel\\r\\n        \\nArrowhead-shaped fern green sepals, arranged in open stacked calyxes, with dispersed small patches of raw umber pisitls, and well above average coverage with long, average-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nIf you\\'re a patient who at all likes the acrid, fuely, skunky end of the cannabis aroma spectrum, this strain will make your day. This is one of the strongest-smelling strains we\\'ve encountered in some time, both in overall pungency (both pre and post-grind) and in terms of the \"impact\" the smell has on the nostrils. Fuel, skunk, hickory, garlic, body odor, and just a hint of citrus (after it\\'s ground) are the dominant notes on this one, and \"dominant\" is exactly the right word to use to describe them.\\n\\nWhile the taste (like the smell) isn\\'t exactly appealing to many people, it certainly is impressive in the same way as the aroma. Thankfully, the acrid skunkiness is toned down in the flavor a bit, with mostly the fuel, spice, and smoky flavors coming through, with the spice lingering as the aftertaste. \\n\\nThis one was a very fast starter, coming on almost immediately with strong effects. Most of our staff began sweating and had a very noticeable increase in heart rate, which could really prove to be too much excitement for those who suffer from anxiety issues. Along with the racy internal energy it provided, it sent us into a flurry of random thoughts and ideas, making it hard to concentrate at times, as if the raw ideas received little to no processing prior to entering the mind. In short, we felt rather \"crushed\" and unable to do much of anything, preferring to simply sit (or lie down) and hang on for the ride, at times having our legs fall asleep from sitting in the same position for too long. As it finally began to drop in potency around 1 hour, the effects became more functional and elevating, but not in the traditional happy mood elevation sense, but rather more of a heightened state of sensory awareness and internal energy. The effects continued to dwindle through 2.5 hours, simply lingering on from that point.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nAdding some punch to the fairly cerebral Haze, this hybrid is a thoughtful combination of strains that starts off with a bang.\\n\\nChemDog x Super Silver Haze\\n\\nMale is reported to be Shantibaba-era Green House Super Silver Haze (#7 phenotype?).\\xa0\\nThis cross is different from \"ChemHaze\" aka Dawg Daze, which is Chem D x Sensi \\'93 NL#5 x Haze \\n\\nAcrid citrus, chemical pine and cleaner — it is normally Haze-dominant, with only some body odor-like funk as a reminder of the ChemDawg mother. \\n\\nMuch like the smell but adding a unique \"cool\" eucalyptus and some flowery/soapy notes, it again is Haze-dominant. \\n\\nWith a bit of a sledgehammer start, this strain contains a variety of strongly Sativa effects, with the requesite head/eye/face pressure fluctuations, a tingly body, and a slightly rushy edge at times.\\xa0 Once the initial slam wore off about 1 hour in, it dialed in to a fairly functional and social state that felt mentally clear.\\xa0 A bit of drowsiness might creep in as the energy leaves, but it\\'s not a total crash.\\xa0 Recommended primarily as a daytime/early evening\\xa0 med for energy, mood elevation, ocular issues, and its anti-nausea properties. \\n\\nUSA\\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nLikely in the 65 day area\\n\\nThe look was simply spectacular, with wonderful structure, texture, solid harvest timing, and that pristine Sativa appearance.

Great for a late day pick-me-up, especially in situations where you need to maintain some semblance of functionality and mental clarity.\\n\\nChemdog x Super Silver Haze\\n\\nThis sample had some of our favorite type of structure, that wonderful Sativa that isn\\'t fluffy or wispy but still has some space to breathe, letting the long pistils and calyxes all stand out clearly, even from a distance. A healthy light green with orange-brown pistils, and leaving trichomes all over your hands/grinder. \\n\\nThis sample screamed Sativa to our staff with its blend of sharp citrus combined with hints of the chemical pine/cleaner aroma common in Haze varieties. One reviewer who grinds samples picked up a hint of a body odor funk after grind, which definitely recalled the ChemDawg parentage… otherwise, it seemed to be pure Haze smell-wise. It had a nicely pungent scent when handled but was not overpowering at all.\\n\\nThe first few hits were like flowery lemon soap with hints of the sharp chemical smell bite that was present in the smell. There was an interesting \"cool\" eucalyptus-like quality to the smoke and flavor that offset the sharp citrus notes well. \\n\\nA very potent start with welled-up eyes, forehead pressure, a buzzing feeling all around the skull, and a tingly feeling throughout the body… pure Haze feeling off the bat. The initial potency may be a little much for some patients, as it could trend towards the anxious side at times, especially at higher dosages. It was a \\'stealth\\' med for half of our staff, but left the other half\\'s eyes looking glazed-over and low, so it\\'s a dice roll in professional situations. After the strong start, it backed off into a functional and driven energetic state that was moderately social and very clear-feeling throughout. There were some reports of drowsiness after the 2 hour mark, but it wasn\\'t unanimous and might just depend on context/environment.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            (Trainwreck x Trinity) x Jack the Ripper\\r\\n        \\nBred by TGA/Subcool, the female used to breed Chernobyl was from a seed Subcool found in a sample of Trainwreck he got from a grower called Smokescreen.\\n\\nThis was the first experience with this strain for most of our crew, and it was thought to be an overall very pleasant experience, suitable for getting some work done or exercising a creative muscle. Its lasting effects with a long linger and very solid initial potency made up for the somewhat lacking taste and smell, which were just not particularly pungent or memorable. The minor grow flaws took this one down a notch, and we\\'d like to see it in perfect condition… but it was still very nice to look at and provided an easy, enjoyable experience.\\n\\nClaw-shaped dingley green sepals arranged in open stacked calyxes, with bursts of copper pisitls, and average coverage by average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with small heads\\n\\nThis strain had a rather light smell that had a floral citrus quality to it, with some piney sharpness coming out after grinding. It was pleasant but not very pungent, a soft Sativa smell.\\n\\nWhile one reviewer really liked the flavor of this sample, the majority of us felt it was simply average in the taste area, with a piney citrus flavor that wasn\\'t remarkable. Though it wasn\\'t pungent or overtly flavorful, it was a rather smooth smoke that didn\\'t expand much, making it a good choice for patients who don\\'t wish to cough.\\n\\nThough it started off with a collection of head, eye, and chest pressure effects, we had some divergent opinions depending on which time of day we medicated. One reviewer who medicated early in the morning got a very potent-feeling package of cerebral effects that included some visual and auditory distortions. The other reviewers who medicated later in the day had more of a relaxing experience, with only a slight uptick in physical energy to start and a pervading mental energy that kept up throughout the experience.

Trichome coverage was above-average for sure, with quite a few golden and amber-capped trichome heads that were well-preserved. \\n\\nWhile not overtly pungent, the smell of this sample certainly did remind us a bit of cherries — actual cherries, not the uber-sweet candy conception of cherry. It had twinges of OG Kush acridness (some citrus, musk, and spice), but was overall pretty smooth-smelling and pleasant.\\n\\nThere was a faint fruity sweetness mixed in with some mentholated qualities and a bit of spice — overall though, it just had a hashy, smoky quality that wasn\\'t particularly distinct or appealing. The flavor went downhill relatively quickly as well, only really showing itself on the first 2 hits.\\n\\nThis was a fairly typical hybrid experience overall, with a Sativa beginning and an even-handed Indica relaxation throughout. To start, it had our eyes feeling flush and full of pressure, some \"headband\"-like feelings, and a buzzing presence all over the body. Mentally, there were moments of stupor early on where thoughts were difficult to pull out of their hiding spots, but that seemed to clear up within the first hour, when the effects began their decline. This was a bit of a cerebral \"thinker\" strain, more prone to solitary thought or one-on-one social interaction rather than something like a party. It\\'s not one for focus-heavy work due to its tendency for distraction, but it was relatively functional and clear-headed overall like most OG Kush hybrids.

The aroma is a profound pine, chem terpene profile, stocked with pinene and limonene. Further, the structure of the buds gives away its heavy Afghan origin. The live trees grow to be sizable with several branches, much like an OG Kush plant, yet the perfume gives away that the Chinchilla retains much of its Afghan large-cola characteristics.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            An even coverage of trichome stalks that retain the trichome heads through dry, cure and shelf time, the chinchilla is very photogenic. The spiked calyxes swell with short pistils, orange in color. Depending on harvest time and grow conditions (i.e. temperature fluctuations) this strain can turn purple or pink.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Chinchilla carries a juniper smell, not quite citrus, yet not quite deep conifer forest that many OG Kush strains have.

Once the wave of potency died off around 1:15 into it, it released its hold a bit and we were more social and active, with occasionaly moment of mental haze.

The absolutely beautiful trich-laden appearance hinted at the potency that lay in wait, but not the complex interactions of Indica and Sativa going on at all times. The strangely focused and quick movement paired with the calmed and warm body was pretty unique and thoroughly enjoyable.

Though moderately expansive, it wasn\\'t harsh at all, but burned to a mottled gray and black ash, indicating it might\\'ve benefited from a more thorough flush.\\n\\nA very direct and focused energy to start, with quick, precise movement and a strong mind-body connection — there was a tendency to feel almost jittery, but that subsided after the first 15 minutes or so. The divergent hybrid nature of this strain was felt immediately, with potent head effects and that lovely warm radiating Afghani body feeling paired throughout the experience. A calm energy with a strong eye presence was the enduring effect of this strain — the Black Domina seems to really calm down the C-99 and keeps the edge off of it that makes many people nervous about C-99.

Needless to say, we really enjoyed this strain in the \"bag appeal\" areas, but it really shined with its mix of strongly Sativa yet functional effects package that had us feeling motivated, social, and focused.

From the Loompas Headband (an indica phenotype) the Cough Fire Headband gets amazing pine, citrus lemon flavor. From Fire OG, the strain picks up trademark bud structure of OG Kush, and from the Cough, the bud produces a thick, flavorful smoke that many people enjoy in quality hand raised cannabis.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Because of the heavy lineage of Headband and Fire OG, dried flowers have low density, and rather contain swollen calyxes that spiral up axial branches. The flowers grow on several branches, typical of many Headband varietals. Dried buds are light green with few hairs, or pistils.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Pine, citrus and skunk.

That jives with our experience for sure, as it appeared that this one just didn\\'t quite reach the genetic potential it holds. The Coup mother was one of the nicest in-house creations we\\'ve come across, and with the Widow potency, we were expecting a little more of a slam/couchlock experience. But it remained mostly heady (though having GREAT anti-anxiety and solid body relaxation properties), leaving us functional though a little dull-feeling… can\\'t wait to see this one in its completely dialed-in form.\\n\\nCoup de Grace x White Widow Max\\n\\nBred by A20 Labs in Colorado\\n\\nNot outwardly as frosty-looking and tight as the sample we received from its mother plant (the Coup de Grace), this one was a little loose in structure, but it made for a pretty striking appearance and left the hands sticky after handling. Dark army greens overall blended with thick ropey orange pistils — the tall, just-on-the-verge-of-ambered trichomes weren\\'t that apparent until under the scope.\\n\\nThis sample carried strong notes of peaches and blueberries along with a little of the saccharine sweet you find in Bubblegum strains. An interesting almost liquor-like menthol sweet bite was present as well, with above-average pungency overall.\\n\\nWhile it was difficult to pick up (one review reported no taste), we were able to notice a floral and ethereal berry sweetness with hints of smokey almost tequila-like flavor. Perhaps due to the tiny seeds, the taste went downhill quickly after the first 2 hits\\n\\nA warm body and a nearly spinning head started us off with this one, a nice sting of potency right at the beginning that was felt mainly in the head and eyes, which filled up with mild pressure and lasted almost the entire first hour. After that hour had passed, it retreated to a fairly neutral yet relaxed state where mood wasn\\'t necessarily enhanced but not soured either. Mentally relaxed an pain-free, but a little slow and dull-feeling, the latter part of the med did feel more on the Indica side, which we had been waiting for based on the White Widow Max father.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nDespite the long duration, this one didn\\'t stay at peak potency for very long, only feeling strong for 45 minutes or so , then feeling eminently functional and basically scaling down from there until it was barely noticeable at about two and a half hours. That said, the effects were great for all of us and made this a pretty perfect daytime medication no matter the activity… it would be good for creative pursuits, data entry/menial type of work, watching a movie, etc. — anything where sustained attention is desirable would be enhanced by this one. Taste and smell-wise, it pretty much brought the expected Jack Herer bag of smells and tastes, though the smell in particular was top-notch and would be the deciding factor to make us give this strain a try amongst 20 others. This is recommended as a fairly motivational and focused daytime type of med for those who don\\'t need serious pain relief or enduring top-level potency.\\n\\r\\n            Jack Herer x Critical Mass\\r\\n        \\nBred by DinaFem Seeds\\n\\nThough this sample probably wouldn\\'t stand out in a row of jars full of top shelf strains, it certainly belongs there judging from its coating of well-preserved trichomes and overall healthy appearance.\\n\\nThis strain smelled like almost every other top-notch Jack Herer or Jack hybrid (including Jack Flash) and definitely ranked among the top examples we\\'ve had in that vein — super fresh and \"cool\" lemon-pine cleaner smell with a wonderful backing floral sweetness that seemed to come out more post-grind. The post-grind smell reminded one reviewer of grenadine — very nice. It wasn\\'t super-pungent mostly due to its Haze nature, but did majorly increase in pungency when ground-up.\\n\\nNot quite as \"Jack-y\" as the smell, the flavor was a little more muted, with some slightly earthy notes at times overpowering the spicy, flowery Haze flavor. The smoke was very smooth and non-expansive, making this a superb choice for patients who don\\'t want to cough when medicating. It burned away to a light gray ash, showing that it had received a proper flush before harvest.\\n\\nThis was a very cerebral Sativa, leaving one reviewer staring blankly at the TV for 15 minute stretches and the others feeling rather energetic and motivated by their tasks. The \"staring blankly\" review wasn\\'t due to couchlock or mental sedation, but rather due to the way this strain causes your attention to dial into whatever happens to interest you at the time, an almost unwavering focus. Physically, the strain started with the hallmark Sativa effects such as orbital/eye/head pressure, a slightly buzzing body, and an uptick in both mood and heart rate. There wasn\\'t much of a direct body effect, but we all felt capable and pain-free throughout the experience, able and willing to take on almost any task while also looking the part (very \\'stealth\\' med — no outward physical effects).\\n\\r\\n            Spain\\r\\n        \\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWe always have a place for moderately potent Indica strains in our lives, and this strain fit that bill perfectly, signaling its Afghani roots in smell, flavor, and effect. Though not overtly potent except right at the beginning, this strain had good \"torque\" and kept up at a fairly high level, declining smoothly over the 2nd half of the duration and leaving behind a relaxed and capable mind. It didn\\'t help with severe pain, but it did really make our bodies feel good, and we like this strain mostly as an evening relaxer for days when a little mental uplift and a few hours on the couch leading into sleep is the perfect recipe.\\n\\nAfghani x Skunk #1 (originally from Mr. Nice Seeds, their version of Sensi\\'s Big Bud)\\n\\nBred by Mr. Nice Seedbank\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThin claw-shaped wasabi green sepals with armadillo accents arranged in open spiral calyxes, snaked with shocks of ochre pisitls, and above average coverage by short, thick-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nSlightly earthy, musky, and lightly citrusy smell which limited pungency, even after grinding\\n\\nA base piney, earthy type of profile that was somewhat pungent, but didn\\'t really taste like anything specific of noteworthy. It wasn\\'t just the taste of smoke itself, but was not too far from that point — the Afghani seems to have taken charge in the flavor department for sure, as there was no Dutch Skunk sweetness in it at all. \\n\\nThis medicine came on fairly strong to start, hitting behind the eyes and giving a somewhat heavy feeling (like being pulled downwards) throughout the body. An uptick in head pressure and a vibrating/buzzing feeling around the scalp and face made for a relaxing experience, as did the buzzing body. The reviewer who had the largest dosage felt a bit more mentally-stilted than the others, staying in that slightly spacey, stare-at-nothing type of state for much of the first hour. The others reported a less heavy feeling during this period, one that left them able to function if needed, and overall elevating the mood and making for a placid, smiley mood overall. Regardless, the main feelings began to decline around 1 hour, leaving behind either a smooth relaxation, or a deep one, largely depending upon dosage. One reviewer who did the review late fell asleep at the 1.5 hour mark, earlier than normal for him, and awoke feeling wonderful, so we believe there are some sleep aid properties to this one for sure.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\n?Seed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA wonderful strain that possessed brute strength without leading me through a frenzy of mental distress.

Though we wanted the taste to match the lovely smell, it was adequate and didn\\'t harm the experience in the least — the smoke was very smooth and enjoyable. The area where this strain really shined though was in its initial potency and its long-lasting duration, both of which were top-notch. In previous experience with the Northern Lights used in this cross, that was true of that strain as well — very enduring med that stays at medicinal levels longer than most. The particular brand of functional Indica relief this strain offered will help almost anyone dealing with daily pains and stresses while leaving them able to live their lives capably and handle social and professional situations.

It also had some hints of soil (probably the Northern Lights influence) and pine as well, making it a well-rounded spectrum of pleasing aromas.\\n\\nThis strain had a middling taste — it certainly wasn\\'t bad, but it just didn\\'t grab us in the way we were expecting after the aroma. It had many of the same elements, they just weren\\'t as strong or noticeable — it was a slightly sweet piney Haze type of flavor with hints of the cleaner sharpness.\\n\\nIt mostly seemed to hit the head to start, giving us a buzzing feeling around the crown of the head, a slight increase in eye/brow pressure, some ear ringing, and a bit of a light head. Almost before we noticed, this strain seemed to lift us up off the couch and into a slew of activities requiring a moderate amount of focus — it had moments of slight raciness, but was overall very comfortable. It seemed to be a bit of a \"creeper\", building in effect through 30 minutes, when it had a full compliment of effects including strongly burning eyes. Almost trance-like at times, it had us feeling functional despite being very medicated and relaxed… it managed to retain mental clarity throughout the duration. It didn\\'t seem to do a ton for muscle tension despite the high levels of mental relaxation, but showed great promise with appetite stimulation.

This was a very pungent and unique sample…\\n\\nWhile one reviewer got a reasonably strong and very enjoyable taste from this strain, the majority of the crew struggled to get a read on it and weren\\'t that impressed by what they did get. A fleeting, perfume-like sweetness was all the majority reported, but the one who liked it picked up on a floral-leaning citrus sweetness that faded out after about 2 hits, followed by a fuel-tinged aftertaste. \\n\\nThis was the area that this strain really shined, providing a near-immediate package of potent effects that got on top of a few of our staff members, surprising them a little bit. Very intense head and eye pressure fluctuations combined with almost mind-numbing potency had us sitting and trying to get our bearings for the first 15 minutes or so. A fairly strong body presence developed during that time as well, with a wave of relaxation and body waves washing over us and making the near-psychedelic effects a little easier to handle. Once the initial burst left us, it calmed down into a relaxed state that still had us feeling some of the head pressure and eye presence into the 3rd hour. This was a very enduring med that kept up medicinal-level effects almost into the 2nd hour.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nComing out of the breeding projects of a grower known as \"High & Lonesome\", with the blessings of Top Dawg Seeds (the holders of Tres Dawg), this hybrid combines the legendary Purple Urkle clone with JJ-NYC\\'s fiercely potent Tres Dawg, which is essentially a Chem D backcross. \\xa0The Urkle imparts its signature coloration and some of its aroma and flavor, but the added sharp chemical kick of the Chem D makes everything more interesting than a standard \"purple\" and make this variety one of the strongest-smelling strains in almost any garden. \\xa0Also increased is the potency of the Urkle, making it much more sedative and hard-hitting cerebrally — this strain is best used in the evenings, as it can lead to sleep due to the deep relaxation and strong ocular effects is offers.\\n\\nPurple Urkle x Tres Dawg (Chem D x [Chem D x Afghani])\\n\\nBred by \"High & Lonesome\" (aka H&L), this strain is fairly new (circa 2009) and though it originated on the East Coast, it is quickly gaining a reputation for its potency and incredible smell through the medical marijuana dispensaries of Colorado and California. \\xa0The strain is named after a David Grisman song of the same name. \\xa0The so-called \"Poodle Nuts\" cut is the most prized and was selected and spread by a grower known as \"forty\".\\n\\nDark leaves and purple petioles lend an undoubtedly Indica appearance to the plant overall, and it will often finish completely purple depending upon nutrient regime and temperature. \\xa0Most often the finished buds are a robust medium green with bright orange pistils, with mottled purple tinges appearing commonly on the top nugs moreso than the lower buds. \\xa0Large, fat calyxes bristle with tall, medium-headed trichomes which pack the surface with a density in the upper\\xa0echelon\\xa0of strains. \\xa0The buds are most similar to Urkle buds in overall appearance, round and swelled-up with a moderate amount of leaves mixed in.\\n\\nOne of the most pungent strains we\\'ve ever encountered, the very complex interplay of the Urkle\\'s grape-spice musk and the Tres Dawg\\'s hair-curling Chem-skunk funk will impress anyone who likes an aggressive aroma. \\xa0The plant when growing will stink more than 95% of strains and that translates to the final product as well — buds left untouched will exhibit a more soft Purple-tinged aroma, but as soon as they\\'re broken apart, it\\'s deep ChemDawg acridness and skunk-fuel all the way.\\n\\nFalling just shy of the aroma in terms of overall pungency, the Waltz\\'s flavor matches the qualities of the smell perfectly, offering the same blend of fruity-spicy Purple sweetness and overwhelming Chemmy funk.\\n\\nIf raw potency is what you desire, the Waltz will certainly scratch that itch, hitting hard immediately and not letting up for a solid 2 to 3 hours, even catching veteran users by surprise with its complete package of effects. \\xa0An immediate burst of warmth and pressure in the eyes and a fiercely vibrating body effect blends perfectly and helps the user relax but also fills them with a strange cerebral energy which is conducive to sedentary activities and projects as well as socialization. \\xa0The initial 30 minutes to 1 hour period of effects feel like a true hybrid, with just enough Sativa influence to keep the mind active and the mood high — however, the Indica side of things normally takes over past that point, making the mental state more pensive and relaxed and continuing the loose, massaged feeling throughout the body.\\n\\nThough it produces a moderate-to-large yield of rock-hard and large-calyxed buds, the Waltz also produces quite a lot of fan leaves, and fairly aggressive defoliation is suggested in order to maximize yield of lower bud sites. \\xa0The plant is a fairly heavy feeder, often requiring additional Cal-Mag through early flower. \\xa0It grows rather stout and bushy, with only a small stretch during flowering, mostly fattening up rather than growing upwards. \\xa0Taking it on the early side of the harvest window normally results in the best flavor and a more cerebral effect, while allowing some amber trichomes to develop puts this strain squarely on the Indica side of things effects-wise and seems to take some of the sweetness out of the flavor.\\n\\nEast Coast of the United States\\n\\nLimited seed release, but it\\'s mostly clone-only, with a few different select cuts floating around\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n54 - 60 days\\n\\nA real treat for Diesel-lovers and those seeking a balanced overall experience, this Death Star really did bring the best of both its parent strains. Early Diesel effects subsided into an ultra-relaxing and sedative Indica that carried a variety of medical benefits. The grow quality was top-notch, with no real flaws and a pleasing appearance, smell, and taste. The potency is rather high overall and it lasted a long time, so we\\'d recommend this mostly to moderate to experienced patients who like an acrid taste spectrum and an up-then-down experience.\\n\\r\\n            Sour Diesel x Sensi Star\\r\\n        \\nBred in 2001-2002 by Team Deathstar in Ohio, the clone began moving through elite circles circa 2004-2005\\n\\nWith its strong green and orange coloring, solid structure, and a very nice coating of frost, Death Star haS a classic yet impressive look, made up mostly of large calyxes well-covered in trichomes\\n\\nMaybe the highlight of this strain, the aroma was very pungent, both pre and post-grind. The sour fuel stank carried notes of rubber, menthol, and lemon but also had a strange sweetness lingering in the background. The combination of those smells made this one really noteworthy and impressive to our staff — great choice for Diesel-lovers.\\n\\nVery much like the smell, the taste was a slight sweet Diesel-dominant flavor with hints of citrus and soil and hash. The sweetness was elusive and seemed to come and go, but when the whole package was present, it was top-notch. \\n\\nA building pressure in the eyes and around the back of the head and temples started things off, with an increase in heart rate and some perspiration happening at times. The body started buzzing early on and that kept up throughout the experience, though it turned to more of a warming feeling as it went on. The Indica side of this cross showed up almost out of nowhere, with a couchlocked yet mentally clear and social effect coupled with the warm and relaxed body. This one seemed to depend on mood and time of day a bit, as a large dosage in the evening sent one reviewer to bed unexpectedly, but most daytime reviews were very relaxed but not narcotic or sleep-inducing.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n60-67 Days\\n\\r\\n            (unknown)\\r\\n        \\nA Colorado-bred high-CBD strain, reportedly testing at 17% CBD and 7% THC\\n\\nInteresting little nugs, beautiful purple hue and quite dense.\\n\\nPungent smell resembling sweet menthol and fertilizer.\\n\\nCoarsely sweet, hashy aftertaste.\\n\\nSlow to rise, the Desert Frost was not one to bar from precision and movement, rather one to induce creativity and valuable brainstorming.

Its calming influence went a long way in reducing daily stresses and pains while keeping us fully engaged in the world. The body relaxation likely came from the relatively high CBD ratio for a strain not intended to be a CBD-rich varietal, which was among the highest we\\'ve seen — that factor made this strain really feel like a worthwhile hybrid… it\\'s more than just a Sativa. We recommend this to almost any level of patient who seeks mental ease and a positive mood shift while still getting some Indica qualities in the body.\\n\\r\\n            Kryptonite x NYC Diesel\\r\\n        \\nA blend of frosty greens with bright orange pistils, this sample was pretty textbook-looking, but we mean that in the best way possible. Super frosty in spots , the nugs were moderately dense and easy to handle. \\n\\nPiney sour citrus, like a fresh grapefruit with a backdrop of skunk and a sweetness that seemed to be overwhelmed by the other smells. Relatively pungent, it pretty much retained its same smell in the jar as when it was ground. Seems to be NYCD-dominant, though lacking the actual Diesel smell.\\n\\nMuch like the smell, it was citrus-pine at the front, but the taste had a slightly more acrid quality, edging more towards the \"pine cleaner\" end of the spectrum and losing the subtle sweetness that was present in the smell — rather pungent-tasting overall.\\n\\nHitting the eyes pretty quickly this strain had us feeling immediately a bit spaced-out and sent our vision into a slight tunnel while also creating a buzzing body energy throughout our limbs and torso. The fairly potent start receded somewhat quickly to a more relaxed state where we felt creative and positive, seeking the company of others and only occasionally fumbling around in conversation. The mood elevation was even and constant throughout the experience — one reviewer noticed quite a lot of muscle relaxation later in the duration, where yawning and stretching felt amazing. Clean finish back to a sober state without much of a drained feeling.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA classic strain since the 1970s, DJ Short\\'s Blueberry line delivers an unmistakable sweet blueberry aroma and upbeat high.

Though it is a sativa-dominant variety, it has the tendency at higher dosages to live up to its strain name, giving the user an extremely relaxed, almost narcotic feeling to go along with all the cerebral effects the Diesel and Chem family are known for.\\nAs Dopium’s high whittles away, the effect becomes more narcotic and relaxing, giving a bit of the classic sativa \"crash\" which can send a previously excitable user to bed by the second hour.\\xa0The \"up then down\" style of the experience can be mitigated by a smaller dosage, repeated over shorter duration — this will keep the \"up\" side rolling and stave off the sleepy side of the effects. Overall, Dopium is something we\\'d call an early evening strain, great for some socializing and fun before a relaxing finish. It aids with energy, appetite, and mood early on, then muscle relaxation, anti-anxiety, and sleep aid properties complete the experience.\\n\\nChem\\'s Sister x Sour Diesel\\n\\nFound by a grower named \"ToneDawg\", this strain is simply a stellar bagseed. \\xa0The cut was passed onto one of the owners at Denver Relief, and it\\'s since become one of their signature varieties. \\xa0As far as we\\'re aware, this particular cut is not available for sale in any other dispensary… at least not under this same strain name.\\n\\nLots of bracts vs. leaf coverage on this one, and it has the very dark green leaves and signature pink salmon-colored stigmas of the Sour Diesel side of the lineage, while also occasionally purpling up on the fringes by finish like the Chem\\'s Sister. \\xa0The plant gets somewhat tall but will produce a solid yield when let finish through 70 days. \\xa0The trichome coverage of this variety again mirrors the parents — it\\'s one of the frostier plants you\\'ll come across in dried nug form. \\xa0Most nugs tend to have a fairly loose structure, similar to the Sour Diesel, with tiny dark leaves interspersed with stacking bracts which look almost grey due to the density of trichomes.\\n\\nThe complex and pungent bouquet the Dopium offers is certainly Diesel-dominant, with that sharp chemical-fuel-rubber element which so many connoisseurs seek out taking the forefront and practically assaulting the senses. \\xa0However, there are some interesting floral and spice notes present which differentiate this cut from other Chem-Diesel hybrids and seem to influence the flavor as well.\\n\\nLess outright acrid than the aroma, the flavor still has strong notes of chemical pine and hickory smoke. \\xa0The floral side of things lingers in the aftertaste makes it more palatable for those patients who love Diesel type effects but cannot handle the \"Chem breath\" flavor it often leaves behind… this is a lower key, more measured Chem-Diesel experience. \\xa0The smoke is rather expansive without being harsh when well-grown.\\n\\nImmediately heady and cerebral, it normally gives a burst of energy and mental activity early on, filling the user with a desire to laugh and talk. \\xa0At higher dosages, it can get a little spacey and cause occasional lapses in concentration, but the good mood and overall energy boost seems to mostly smooth over that aspect of things. \\xa0Along with the energy, there is a strong face and eye presence which at times gives the \"headband\" feeling of constriction. \\xa0The elevated state of being only lasts for about the first 45 minutes or so, when the timbre of the experience changes to a more sedentary, relaxing one as the strain shifts gears into its decline of effects.\\n\\nGiven the genetics, expect a stretch with this cut. \\xa0Like most varieties with wide internodal spacing, it\\'s advisable to net or otherwise train the plants so they are not so lanky.\\n\\nColorado, USA\\n\\nClone only, extremely limited availability\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n70 days\\n\\nThough we missed the acrid Sour Diesel part of the equation at times, this was a very enjoyable Diesel experience that was neither too heavy nor too light. It felt like a true hybrid, with a blend of Sativa and Indica effects that played well together rather than battling for attention. The appearance was top-notch, with its sound but distinct structure, copious trichome coverage, and lack of flaws. The smell was right up our alley and seemed NYCD-dominant with a grapefuit bent. Overall, we like this med as a daytime or early evening strain for those looking for some mood elevation, relaxation, and appetite stimulation — it\\'s suitable for all levels of patient because it was never too strong but can be enjoyed even by the connoisseurs.\\n\\r\\n            Sour Diesel x New York City Diesel\\r\\n        \\nA Colorado clone variety\\n\\nWe all really liked the look of this one, from its foxtailed structure to its impressive trichome coverage. Just a very pretty example of a Diesel strain, with a strong lime green color, and peach pistils.\\n\\nThis one had some of the typical diesel notes in the jar/bag before it was ground up, but they seemed to disappear, turning into more of a sweet herby grapefruit… it seemed to be both sweet and musky at the same time, which is certainly unique. It seems that the NYCD dominated the smell department, not much of the acrid, pungent Sour Diesel smell at all… in this case, that wasn\\'t a bad thing.\\n\\nSimilar to the smell but much less sweet-tinged, the taste was also a semi-musky citrus with some menthol qualities. It turned a bit more to the earthy/smoky side as it burned away, but overall was rather pleasant the whole way through. One reviewer reported some post-smoking throat burn, but the others felt it was a pretty smooth smoke despite being fairly thick. Pretty average taste overall, which was slightly disappointing after the top-notch aroma.\\n\\nA typical diesel start, with pressure in the sinuses/cheeks/eyes, tickling/ringing in the ears, and a buzzing presence through out the body, at times feeling like butterflies in the stomach. It was never what we\\'d describe as \\'rushy\\', but it was definitely heady and Sativa in nature to start. As the experience progressed, it seemed to take us to a middle-ground in a manner of ways — mood-wise, energy-wise, and mentally we seemed on an even keel. It had moments of sociability and laughter interspersed with moments of withdrawn silence and introversion. While feeling capable overall, there were also moments of short term memory loss and general slowness. As it faded out, there was some drowsiness, but nothing overwhelming that you can\\'t shake off in the middle of the day.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis strain was so Indica in every way, with its super dense and blocky nug structure, its sweet scent, and its heavy couchlock-inducing effects. While it wasn\\'t our favorite in terms of a daily use medication, it would be great for those days where you want to do nothing but sit around and relax, or days when pain or loss of appetite make life very difficult.\\n\\r\\n            Bubblegum BX2\\r\\n        \\nClaw-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stacked calyxes, striped with shocks of indochine brown pistils, and average coverage with thin, short-stalked bent trichomes with average heads\\n\\nVery nice and super sweet Bubblegum smell, one of the most uncanny gum smells around. It turned a bit more fruity when ground and lost the saccharine sweetness.\\n\\nThough it had traces of that strong sweetness and the actual gum flavor, this one tasted mostly like a bit of a \"fruit punch\", with a blend of fruity and sweet flavors and a flowery finish. The smoke was extremely thick and dense (like the nug) but also had a bit of unwanted harshness that burned the throat.\\n\\nThis Double Gum was an Indica-dominant experience for sure, with a heavy feeling behind the eyes and a hanging warmth over the body. Sitting gape-mouthed staring at something was not an uncommon effect, and the heavy almost wobbly head made sitting way more satisfying than moving around. It was functional enough but it was much nicer to sit on the couch and just enjoy it. Appetite stimulation was evident, and this was basically a typical Indica effects package thould be nice for an evening session.\\n\\r\\n            Bubblegum is originally from Kentucky/Indiana, USA, but this was bred in Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            White Label Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA landrace sativa variety from South Africa, Durban Poison is known for its spicy/sweet anise-like smell and taste and its clear-headed cerebral effect. Though it\\'s a (normally) pure sativa, most versions finish fairly quickly and don\\'t stretch like crazy. Many claim the real South African Durban Poison is very racy and finishes as long as 120 days, but that\\'s not the case for the versions available in seed form (Afropips and African Seeds seems to be the longest to finish).\\nPer Sam the Skunkman, “South African Durban Poison was first introduced by me. I got maybe 100 seeds from South Africa and grew them in California in the late 70s. Most were hermaphrodite, small calyxes, as well as not so great buds. But I saw the potential for an early sativa so I worked with it for a few years to clean it up. I finally eliminated most of all the bad traits, and introduced it in the early 80s.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I took it to Amsterdam it was an immediate hit, one of the few sativa strains that can be grown outdoors in Holland most years if the weather is okay at harvest time. Every seed merchant in Holland bought some and made copies as well as hybrids; all of the Durban Poison genetics being passed around were originally from my work until Afro-Seeds popped up a few years ago. My Durban Poison is sativa, pure IBL landrace created from seed lines, maintained with clones, male and female. There is no change in the gene pool now as any seeds are produced from selected clones 20 years old. The plants had a strong licorice/anise smell and taste, as well as being quite early in maturation. The strength was med-strong, vigor strong, yield quite good, very consistent. To be honest I considered it a daytime smoke.”\\n\\n\\nClick here to purchase your own Durban Poison seeds and start growing!\\n\\n\\n\\nLandrace South African variety, at times crossed with Skunk for stability\\n\\n\\nDurban is known for possessing a very distinct blend of sweet and spicy smells — fennel/anise, orange, lemon, and a creamy sweetness are the most common descriptors.\\n\\nVery sweet and intoxicatingly complex, Durban Poison presents the sativa-lover with a palate of flavors ranging from sweet lemon candy to spicy anise, making it a favorite of many dispensary patients as well as connoisseurs.\\n\\nDurban is a fabulous daytime strain, with a clear, functional effects package that stimulates creativity, sociability, and overall mood.\\xa0 It\\'s very energetic and is seen as one of the more pure-feeling sativa varieties widely available on the market. The true South African Durbans are known for being extremely racy and borderline psychedelic, but the toned-down Dutch versions that circulate the United States and Europe lose some of that edge, perhaps for the benefit of the average consumer. \\xa0The primary medicinal benefits are energy, appetite stimulation, migraine relief, and anti-nausea properties. \\n\\nDurban was known and loved in Holland because it was one of the few sativas that could finish outdoors — the short-flowering versions are suitable for Northern climates.\\xa0 Grows very tall outdoors, but most varieties are totally manageable indoors, especially with training such as SCROG.\\n\\nSouth Africa\\n\\nMany versions available in seed form — African Seeds, Dutch Passion, Afropips, Nirvana, and Sensi Seeds all have versions of it.\\n\\r\\n            Sativa\\r\\n        \\nDepends on the version, most floating around or from Dutch companies are between 8 and 10 weeks, while the African seed companies tend to be longer, going as long as 120 days.\\n\\nOne of Colorado\\'s underground favorites before becoming a staple in Boulder, CO, Dutch Treat Haze is one of the most wonderful Haze hybrids around, bringing the absolute best parts of Green House Seeds\\' famous Super Silver Haze but moderating the sativa effect with the uplifting yet still indica-dominant Amsterdam strain Dutch Treat. Both parent strains have a citrus element to them, and that comes out in this hybrid, but it also has interesting funky notes of eucalyptus, sandalwood, and floor cleaner.\\nThe Super Silver Haze used in this cross is from old Dutch stock, as is the Dutch Treat. This strain shows what new breeding projects can do to reinvigorate what many consider as staid genetic lines, creating very exciting new hybrids.\\n\\nDutch Treat x Super Silver Haze\\n\\nPrior to the establishment of HB 1284 which changed the dispensary scene in Colorado significantly in terms of supply chain, this strain was everywhere and in high demand because the creator was able to sell it to any dispensary who wanted it. \\xa0Once the legislation changed and centers had to grow at least 70% of their own cannabis, the creator ended up with Boulder Medical Marijuana Center and the strain has been an in-house favorite ever since, only occasionally being sold elsewhere.\\n\\nVery light, almost minty green calyxes encase thin pink-red pistils and the nug shape overall is pointed, especially on the non-cola buds, which pop up in perfect little triangles on the stem almost at random. \\xa0The trichome coverage and structure is what we\\'d consider almost perfect, with moderate-sized heads of perfect rounded shape capping medium stems that cover the plant surface in a very even fashion. \\xa0The deep sparkle that the dried nugs possess make this an incredible \"bag appeal\" variety for a Sativa-lover.\\n\\nThe complex but undeniably Sativa aroma the Dutch Treat Haze offers blends the punchy, reedy side of the Haze family with the sweet, crisp citrus side (which is given an added boost by the sweet and also-citrusy Dutch Treat). \\xa0The perfect melding of Haze aromas in the flowers themselves also results in a wonderful floral-fresh-sweet-smelling smoke when it\\'s combusted — in all, a treat for the nose.\\n\\nMuch like the smell, the flavor combines the sweet-citrusy Haze and Dutch Treat with the eucalyptus-funky Haze\\xa0elements that often come out of good old-stock Super Silver Haze. \\xa0The flavor is especially noticeable and enjoyable in a joint, where the crisp flavor hangs on the lips all the way through to the crutch and lingers in the mouth and sinuses after smoking.\\n\\nA near-immediate influx of pressure to the eyes and face area signal the arrival of this potent and torquey Sativa. \\xa0The internal buzzing and energetic-feeling waves that rush over the body can trend towards the racy and anxious side of things, but patients who don\\'t struggle with nerve excitement or heart-based anxiety issues shouldn\\'t have any issues. \\xa0Through the beating heart, the internal motivation fills the mind with racing thoughts and makes socializing at times difficult simply because the mind is so busy — however, experienced users and lovers of true Sativas will enjoy this more than see it as a possible detriment. \\xa0The final hour or so of the experience takes a decidedly Indica turn, partly from the \"crash\" that so often comes with powerful Sativas, but partly with the onset of the relaxing Dutch Treat presence. \\xa0This one is a great choice for appetite, mood elevation, and energy.\\n\\nBMMC runs the DTH in both very large DWC setups as well as peat-based soil setups and has great success, so the plant can do well in any medium. \\xa0It seems to retain its natural flavor better than many strains when grown in hydro, so that may be the best choice for those looking for maximum trichome coverage, \"bag appeal\", yield, and flavor. \\xa0The plant itself grows tall and fairly branchy, making it suitable for SCROG moreso than SOG applications — training and a good veg period will reap major rewards yield-wise.\\n\\nColorado, U.S.A.\\n\\nClone-only, bred by the master grower at Boulder Medical Marijuana Center (BMMC)\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n75-80 days\\n\\nA surprising favorite amongst the staff, this potent medicinal Indica has a place with any patient who struggles with pain or appetite especially, but it\\'s also a great choice for anyone later in the day or when being physically active isn\\'t required.

East Coast Sour Diesel, also known as NYC Diesel -- The lore around Sour Diesel is immense-- is a vigorous sativa. Meanwhile, Alien Technology is an Afghan landrace indica. \\n\\nA balanced hybrid with growth traits of both an Old World Kush and Sour Diesel, a vigorous sativa in vegitative and flower stages of its growth. \\n\\nFinished buds are dense but with some fingers, as a result of the heavy diesel ancestry. Light green calyxes are encased in purple old world kush style leaves. \\n\\nFuel and earth tones, rather complex. \\n\\nSour on the inhale and a bitter kushy exhale \\n\\nRight in the middle of the effect spectrum, East Coast Alien will deliver a rounded experience with slight motivation and creativity, while relaxing, and with classic appetite stimulation after a medium-long durration of psychoactive effects. \\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThe mood elevation was instant and lasting, but the potency was never all that high, and leveled off to a very mild state after about 1.5 hours, which is shorter than we\\'d like. However, the total duration including lingering eye effects was in the 3 hours area, so patients who medicate for ocular relief might find it more useful than others.\\n\\r\\n            Northern Lights #1 x Haze\\r\\n        \\nBred in-house by Tree of Life Alternative Medicine in Colorado\\n\\nA long, slender sample, this strain showed its Sativa dominance in its structure and average density. It was a pale green for the most part, but there were some extremely dark almost blue leaves visible.\\n\\nhis sample was a very subdued smell that consisted of fresh vegetation, pine, and a slight sweetness. \\n\\nWe mostly got standard smoke notes (often called \"hashy\") along with more of the pine and slight sweetness that were present in the smell.\\n\\nThey could call this strain \"mood elevation\" — it really makes you smile to begin with and gives the urge to laugh at almost anything. Starting strong in the eyes and continuing that throughout the experience, this strain feels alternately light and heavy, fluctuating between a floaty head and a heavy body. Despite the sometimes heavy feeling, tasks (both mental and physical) were never an issue, making this a solid choice for retaining productivity while medicated. As it went on, it reduced itself down to a calm body and retained the mood elevation, making for a long lingering finish and a soft drop back to normalcy.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWhile we are not really fans of the smell and taste of this strain, the effects were enjoyed thoroughly by the staff. This strain provided a solid combination of mood uplift and strong body relaxation while keeping functionality mostly intact — this is a somewhat rare combination of effects that were perfect for fighting off the urge to get up when doing solitary work. The strange purple cast the trichomes had over the entire surface of the bud was also rather unique, especially when viewed with our microscope. If you\\'re a patient that is looking for muscle and pain relief but don\\'t want to be zombiefied and overtly sleepy, this is a very good choice.\\n\\r\\n            Unkown\\r\\n        \\nBred by Vancouver Island Seed Company\\n\\nIf you\\'re a patient who likes big, blocky, dense structure this is the strain for you. Clearly Indica in structure, this strain has a large, conical bud shape with a collection of dark coloration, including an odd lavender cast to most of the trichomes (a few purple heads were spotted, but it was mostly the stems).\\n\\nThe smell of this one was typical hashy Indica with just a hint of sweetness that seemed to disappear as fast as it came. A hint of \"garlic bud\" type aroma stuck out at one reviewer as well — our opinion is that this is clearly an Afghani lineage plant based on the smell.\\n\\nMuch like the smell, this was a very generic and boring taste for us, simply tasting like hashy smoke for most of the duration. One reviewer did pick up hints of pine and a slight cherry-like sweetness, but it was fleeting. The flavor took a downturn mid-way through the session, bringing a bad, slightly bitter aftertaste to the party that we didn\\'t enjoy at all. The final flush appeared near-perfect though, as the ash was a fluffy white… not sure where the iffy aftertaste came from.\\n\\nThis was a fairly unique med in that it felt strongly body-centric and Indica-heavy but seemed to leave the head nearly unaffected and functional. It started almost immediately, with a warming and relaxing body sensation creeping up from the legs through the torso and an overall relaxed mental state taking over. A heavy-headed feeling also came with the territory early on, definitely making us more comfortable on the couch than standing. Logical and social processes seemed uninhibited entirely by this strain, making it good for solitary, sedentary work — it relaxes the body enough to allow the mind to concentrate on the task at hand. If consumed later at night, the relaxation this strain provides will probably lead to sleep.\\n\\r\\n            Canada\\r\\n        \\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n6-8 Weeks\\n\\r\\n            Clone Only Lineage Unknown\\r\\n        \\nFaceoff OG is a 1990\\'s cut of OG Kush.

As one of the original OG\\'s, it is highly sought after. \\n\\nA prime phenotype of OG Kush, this strain is one of the original cuts of OG, beginning to circulate around California grow collectives and just recently the Colorado medical and recreational scene. \\n\\nSkunk, juniper and diesel fuel. \\n\\nSouthern California, 1990\\'s\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant\\r\\n        \\nThe lemony garlic funk of Pacific Northwest clone only Albert Walker beefed up, with added musky notes off of Tom Hill\\'s Deep Chunk.\\xa0 Seriously potent indica.\\n\\r\\n            Albert Walker x Deep Chunk\\r\\n        \\nBred by Scott of Rare Dankness with the Albert Walker genetics provided by The Docta of Archive Seedbank\\n\\n Very dense with a well above average trichome count.

Visual appeal for this one was very high, with an array of beautiful colors and tons of sparkling trichomes that were harvested at the proper time. The smell and taste package were perfect for the strain lineage, and they seemed to match for the most part, which is always appreciated. The clean, heady, and energetic effects were perfect for any daytime use, and there were no physical signs of being medicated… good strain for professional situations. It just wasn\\'t potent enough to get into the upper echelon, but it would be great for times when being strongly medicated isn\\'t desired… this is definitely a great beginner smoke.\\n\\r\\n            Flo x Purple Kush\\r\\n        \\nBred by Karmaceuticals in Denver, Colorado\\n\\nWith no real flaws visible, a great array of coloration, and a thick layer of trichomes, this was a very stunning sample for our staff. The mix of dark green (almost black), lime green, orange/red pistils, and vibrant royal purple in spots made this a very interesting sample to look at.\\n\\nThis sample was a perfect marriage of the two parent strain smell-wise, with the floral and slightly sweet incense notes of the Purple Kush blending with the more herby and spicy Flo\\'s fennel-kissed sweet hash aroma. This was among the cleanest-smelling strains we\\'ve had, absolutely floral and something we could smell all day, even though it wasn\\'t all that pungent until it was broken into.\\n\\nAlmost matching the smell note-for-note, the taste was again a very clean and floral combination of the two parent strains. A little bit of the typical Purple \"grape incense\" type of flavor crept in, but it was balanced by the distinctive taste of Flo. While it wasn\\'t the most pungent-tasting sample around, the taste stayed at a high level until the end, never getting that \"cashed\" taste or displaying any real harshness. This was a smooth and easy smoke, highly recommended for those who can\\'t deal with aggressive strains that make you cough.\\n\\nThis was a light potency strain overall, perfect for a little relaxation while keeping all mental activities running at a high level. Starting off with a delayed effect, it smoothly built to a light, buzzy body feeling that had us motivated and on our feet for most of the review. There was a little bit of head/eye pressure cycling, but overall it was rather clear-headed, with only a bit of euphoria and the desire to shirk responsibilities breaking up the motivated state. As it went along, the body relaxation became more apparent but was still not that direct — as if the mental relaxation moved downwards.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nNot a straight-shot OG like many originals (think Hell\\'s, Tahoe, Faceoff, Ghost) Fruity Pebbles OG is a bred-into OG that resembles much of the same flavor as the originals yet delivers a wide spectrum hybrid effect with a greater flavor pallet.\\n\\nGreen Ribbon x Grand Daddy Purple x Tahoe Alien\\n\\nAlien Genetics\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nI dig it.

The overall grow quality and bag appeal was impressive, while the perfect harvest timing seemed like the veritable cherry on top. The two parent strains really aren\\'t known for their taste and smell (both are generally chosen for their potency), but this cross was still very pleasant to smoke, possessing a nice lemony bite. We recommend this most highly as an after work or late-night med, as it puts the user in a very sedative and relaxed state where even basic communication can at times be too much to deal with. Sinking into the couch and enjoying the mood elevation and warm body presence is probably the most likely effect of this med; a real Indica experience despite the slightly rushy start. Great job by the Biocare crew — it was a very well cared-for sample overall that lasted longer than most and retained medicinal potency well into hour #2.\\n\\r\\n            G-13 x Black Widow\\r\\n        \\nBred by Mr. Nice Seedbank\\n\\nThis was one of the frostiest samples we\\'ve gotten in some time, with a thick coating of trichomes covering nearly every surface. The structure of this sample was also very good, with a moderate density and a hearty stickiness.\\n\\nThough it\\'s not an aroma that really marks itself as distinct or uniquely enjoyable, this G-13 Widow produced a lovely sharp lemon-pine scent with a bit of muskiness and also sweetness in the mix. Lemon is at the forefront though for sure, and it was nicely pungent once broken apart.\\n\\nIt was mostly a fresh and clean-tasting vegetation with a pine element to it — not really something we\\'d seek out, but certainly not a bad flavor. The smoke was smooth despite being rather thick, and the final ash was a very light gray, indicating that it had a proper flush.\\n\\nTo start, this strain had us feeling slightly racy, with an elevated heart beat, a boost of energy, and the urge to be social and active. A lot of head and eye pressure fluctuations, a buzzing warm body, and a slightly slow/hazy mental state were the other initial pieces of this surprisingly Sativa-oriented start. It was at this point where we had a bit of disagreement on the overall tone of the experience — one reviewer continued on the energetic and clear-headed path while the other two were knocked for a relaxing Indica loop. It seems the time of day and situation might play a larger role in the effects of this med than some others — the energetic one was a mid-day review when the reviewer had things to do, and he functioned well. The others were in the morning and later at night when both reviewers were not busy, so the heavy effects seemed to come through harder. In any case, there was strong body relaxation, mental relaxation, and a persistent ocular/forehead effect that continued well into the 2nd hour. The end of the experience was rather sedative and could easily lead into sleep.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n56-63 Days\\n\\r\\n            Ghost\\'s OG Kush x Blue Moonshine\\r\\n        \\nThis cross was originally made by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds when he was operating Stone Mountain Wellness in Longmont, CO.\\n\\nThis particular phenotype selection from seed stock leans heavily towards the Ghost\\'s OG side of the spectrum. \\xa0Blue Moonshine adds an interesting musky sweetness to the zesty ginger-lemon OG flavor of the Ghost, and serves to thicken up the smoke as well as increase the heaviness of the effects. \\n\\nA light and floaty feeling throughout the head and body starts things off, feeling very Ghost-influenced at first, but some body heaviness creeps in later in the duration and grounds the experience a bit. \\xa0Ghost Moonshine is a very relaxing strain but is still somewhat \"up\" mentally, keeping the mood of the user elevated though steady. \\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nGhost OG is one of the most sought after cuts of OG Kush.

We definitely think that this is daytime medicine, as the mental and physical stimulation it gave would likely keep a patient awake at night with mind racing. We actually liked a lower dosage of this strain in terms of daily use, as the psychedelic elements we experienced at high dosages made it less functional both mentally and socially — but those adventurous \\'psychonaut\\' types among the MMJ patient population will likely enjoy those elements of the experience.\\n\\r\\n            Ghost\\'s OG Kush x Nevil\\'s Wreck\\r\\n        \\nBred by Rare Dankness as part of their Ghost Train Haze series pairing legendy OG Kushes with their Nevil\\'s Wreck (Arcata Trainwreck x Neville\\'s Haze) male, this strain redefined maximum potency when High Times tested it at the Cannabis Cup, being named the Strongest Strain on Earth.\\n\\nWide claw-shaped dark olive green sepals arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of red bronze pisitls, and supreme coverage by long, thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average heads\\n\\nUniversally loved by our staff, the aroma didn\\'t have any real hints of the Ghost\\'s OG side of the lineage, but that didn\\'t seem to matter at all. The scent is a wonderfully sweet yet fresh scent that has hints of anise, grenadine, and citrus mixed together into what several reviewers described as \"cherry-limeade\" or a similar sweet-tangy-tart combination. It\\'s very complex and engaging, and also has just enough of a bite post-grind to remind you of the OG and Haze lineage. Top-notch aroma here, one that Trainwreck and Haze lovers especially will enjoy.\\n\\nAfter the world-class aroma experience, it\\'s hard not to be slightly disappointed with the flavor, but this one held up very well. The flavor was a little more OG-tinged than the smell was, giving hints of the pine cleaner type of sharpness combined with a hint of the floral Haze sweetness. One this we really enjoyed about this strain was its extremely smooth smoking experience, which never really gave us the urge to cough and retained flavor to about the midway point of the bowl. \\n\\nWe had some slight disagreements on the overall potency of this hybrid among the review staff — some staff felt that it was in the top 10% of medicine potency-wise, while others (one of whom who has had the strain previously) thought that it just didn\\'t get to that upper level. That said, the uplifting and energizing effects that kick off this experience will make any real Sativa-lover happy, but might border on anxious for those who struggle with the more energizing strains. A strong \\'facial mask\\' feeling of buzzing pressure kept up at a high level, and our eyes tended to be rather red during the early parts of the duration especially… not a \\'stealth\\' med really. Multiple reviewers reported quite a lot of borderline psychedelic activity, including slight auditory and visual hallucinations and at times felt a bit of sensory overload. At lower dosages than our standard KR review portion, the effect was more manageable and sociable, but otherwise it was a bit too challenging mentally to stay engaged with anything other than one\\'s own thoughts for the most part. The main effects began their decline at about 1.5 hours, but the energy and mental activity kept up through almost the end, when a little bit of a Sativa crash crept in and we felt a little stunted mentally and in a somewhat dreamlike mental state to finish.\\n\\r\\n            Colorado\\r\\n        \\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n70-84 Days\\n\\nThought by some to be the \"mother\" of all OG Kush strains to follow, Ghost\\'s cut of OG Kush is a legendary clone-only cut that was possessed by OverGrow.com forum member known as \"OrgnKid,” who then passed it onto another OverGrow.com member known as \"Ghost,\" who then passed it on to a few select individuals.

Choosing the right cannabis seeds is important when cultivating Girl Scout Cookies. Growers who want effective results time after time look for feminized Girl Scout Cookies seeds to ensure that all plants are female and their harvest will be somewhat predictable\\n\\nUnknown in Truth; popularly claimed to be OG Kush x Durban Poison, or OG Kush x Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban Poison)\\n\\nVery little is known about the origin of Girl Scout Cookies. The only certainty is it was bred in San Francisco, California, sometime in the last couple of years; perhaps 2011 or 2012.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe strain was developed by a Nor-Cal group of associates known simply as the Cookie Family. From there, different phenotypes (some perhaps bag-seeds) have been distributed throughout the United States. Most notable of this array of Girl Scout Cookies is the \"Forum Cut,\" made available through internet networking among breeders.\\n\\nGirl Scout Cookies has a tall, branchy, OG-like structure, leaning towards the appearance of a true kush. It has dark leaves that turn black with a complete cold-water flush and have extremely long, thick, wine-red petioles, or leaf stems, that are actually longer than the leaf is in length.\\n\\nTo its name, Girl Scout Cookies has a sweet and spicy, oven-baked smell.\\n\\nFrom the two disclosed parents, Durban Poison and OG Kush, there are taste elements of skunky peppermint and the slightest lemon zest. The \"F1\" unknown parent may be responsible for the yeasty bread-like taste that dominates the pallet.\\n\\nNorthern California, circa 2011-2012\\n\\nThe original is very hard to acquire as the Cookie Fam strictly limits its availability.

A distinct lack of motivation, some spaciness, and the urge to sit around were the main mental feelings this strain caused along with a bit of run-of-the-mill tiredness. However, it did a good job with body effects, delivering a narcotic-feeling experience that left the body very loose, relaxed, and pain-free.

We\\'d warn beginners against this strain, as even a small 0.1g dosage was more than enough to put an experienced patient in another mental dimension for a solid 2.5 hours.

Almost dizzying to start, this sample was truly potent and took even our experienced reviewers a bit by surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother interesting similarity was the shared experience of auditory hallucinations, with one reviewer reporting body vibrations coming from sounds and music far more than normal. The high was concentrated in the head, face, and eyes, with some visual hallucinations and an increase in \"eye floaters.\" It eventually took us to a slightly more relaxed state, where the indica side came out a bit.

This one was a bit confusing to us, but enjoyable and pungent enough to please the staff.\\n\\nWhile one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) experienced no real issues when smoking, two other reviewers disliked the flavor simply because the quality of the smoke seemed to burn the throat slightly and cause immediate coughing. The flavor itself was unremarkable regardless, and was mostly earthy/musky with a hint of sweetness present.\\n\\nEye pressure and a near-immediate body relaxation were the first effects of this Hindu Kush. The fast-acting body relief was surprising, as the relaxation parts of most strains come on beyond the initial effects, once the buzzing or waving feelings have subsided. This one has us pulled down into the couch in no time, improving our mood, but keeping things relatively sedate and calm nonetheless. The potency lasted at its near-peak level through an hour, having us feeling a little bit slow mentally, but cleared up after that point. Fortunately, the body relaxation lasted longer than the mental effects, which made this a clear-headed relaxer for most of its duration.\\n\\nIndia/Pakistan45-50\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant\\r\\n        \\n45-50 Days\\n\\r\\n            [INSUFFICIENT INFO AVAIL]\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hybrid maybe even a 50/50\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sticky with fat-headed trichomes, this strain puts off a powerfully pungent stink of diesel fuel and skunk… can be overwhelming at times.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Kong (Indica-dominant clone-only strain) x Sour Diesel\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Super stinky, smelling of skunk from a distance and then acrid fuel up-close.\\xa0 Notes of gun oil, garlic, and musk complete the pungent package of aromas. \\n\\r\\n            It tastes as if the Sour Diesel took over this cross, with a strong and enduring fuel taste accompanied by a citrus-cleaner sharpness, finishing with a skunky aftertaste. \\n\\r\\n            A strongly Sativa (and clearly Sour Diesel-influenced) start full of head/face/eye pressure, an increased heart rate, some \"headband\" feeling, and a boost of energy gave way to a more couchlocked Indica-dominant finish.\\xa0 While the mind stayed at the ready and was active/engaged, the body was very relaxed and unwilling to accommodate the mental energy.\\xa0 Showed medicinal benefits with muscle relaxation, anti-depression, strong ocular attention, appetite stimulation, other stomach issues, and even sleep aid as it wore on. \\n\\r\\n            Available in Denver, CO — let us know if it\\'s made it out to other parts of the country.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone-only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Slightly Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nKyle Kushman\\'s Strawberry Cough x Bruce Banner #3\\n\\r\\n            Kyle Kushman\\'s Strawberry Cough x Bruce Banner #3\\r\\n        \\nA pleasently relaxing sativa, Kyle Kushman\\'s Strawberry Cough was selected as an anti-anxiety strain.

It was a bit harsh, but not enough to keep someone away, and it had good expansion.\\n\\nA short two minute delay led to a smooth relaxing heady state of sheer relief from a stressful day. One of the first reported effects was a butterfly/stomach feeling which was somewhat unusual for our team. Over the next 20 minutes this strain produced a strong rising effect leading to high level spacyness and distortion of equilibrium. A fun exciting ride was the dominant description, but we also found a lack of presentable functionality, temporary introversion, and avoiding human contact. Relief came for all after about the forty five minute mark and most were able to get back to the comfortable state the first ten minutes had offered.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWith its distinctive and pungent aroma, it\\'s exceptional trichome coverage, and long-lasting and medicinal effects, Ingrid is truly a winner of a strain. This one would do the trick for almost any type of pain or discomfort, and its relaxing effects were both mentally and physically medicating. It would probably get on top of most patients who aren\\'t heavy users, as even a 0.3g dose was enough to put a veteran into the \"overwhelming\" range at the onset. Its enduring medicinal-level efficacy was the key component of its high score, as there was almost no drop-off in effects as the 2nd hour elapsed, which is unusual.\\n\\nSwiss Big Bud IBL\\n\\nIngrid was a strain developed from 2000-2007 from a Swiss variety of Big Bud commonly used for hash production, originally appearing in the San Francisco Bay area\\n\\n\\xa0A uniform medium green with huge tall trichomes and pale orange hairs. It had some of the best trich coverage in terms of density and trich head size that we\\'ve seen; seems like a true Hashplant. Nicely swelled and bubbly calyxes\\n\\nVery strange, uncanny, and pungent odor that smells like sweet citrus dog poop. Especially pre-grind, that is all you can think of — it\\'s a weird putrid sweetness with a sharp attack. After it\\'s grind, it got even stronger with a component of herbiness but mostly an acrid musk and the sweet citrus poo smell. \\n\\nFortunately it didn\\'t taste like it smelled, and instead produced an ethereal and herby taste with notes of sandalwood with notes of sandalwood that almost reminded us of a Haze. Another interesting trait is the wonderful almost menthol-citrus sweet smell the actual smoke had, as it left the room smelling fragrant. The taste wasn\\'t overt at any point, but the smoke was very pleasing and smooth with no coughing.\\n\\nRight off the bat, this strain produced a strong experience, with low eyes and a rising warmth that entered the head, face, and eyes (especially the eyes, which were almost burning). It was nearly dizzying, making it a little bit difficult to walk around without getting a little unbalanced or having to take it a little slower than normal. Once the initial attack subsided (about 30-45 minutes), a glorious and medicating body high was the main effect. Superb relaxation throughout the entire body with a good deal of warmth and the urge to stretch and yawn makes this one perfect for relaxing after a day of physical activity. It stayed at medicinal levels well into the 2nd hour and is one of the better body-centric strains we\\'ve had recently.\\n\\nSwitzerland\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA worldly fusion of inter-continental proportions, this cross from Bodhi Seeds fuses a very rare clone-only creation from Chemdog (of the Chem Dawg strain family fame) in Giesel with Ace Seeds\\' exotic but relatively quick-finishing Bangi Haze. The various phenotypes range from the expected stank of the Giesel to the complex spicy incense-heavy aroma of the Haze, but the most choice phenotypes will exhibit an almost sweet lemony-fuel spice bouquet that is truly something extraordinary. It produces fairly large nugs which often have a uniquely greasy resin profile and normally have moderate leaf coverage.\\nIsaac Haze has strong ocular properties and definitely provides a boost of energy and mental positivity. Though the early stages of some more Haze-dominant phenotypes can be a bit anxious and speedy, it falls short of being considered \"racy\" and that stage falls to the wayside rather quickly regardless, paving the way for an anxiety-free experience replete with appetite stimulation and anti-nausea properties.\\n\\nGiesel (ChemDawg D x Massachusetts Super Skunk) x Ace Seeds Bangi Haze (Congo x Nepalese)\\n\\nA recent (2011) hybrid by Bodhi Seeds, this strain\\'s origins are somewhat unclear except that it went up for international sale during 2011. \\xa0The story of the Giesel revolves around the breeder known as Chemdog, the same man who is responsible for popularizing and breeding the majority of the ChemDawg family line. \\xa0The Giesel combined his Chem D (germinated in 2001 from the original seed stock which produced the original \\'91 Chem) with the notorious clone-only Massachusetts Super Skunk, which was involved in the creation of Sour Diesel as well. \\xa0This serious pedigree made a great match for the exotic Bangi Haze, which comes from the worldly Ace Seeds, a firm which specialized in unique landrace varieties.\\n\\nA mostly pale green plant as it grows, the finished product is equally light in coloration, exhibiting an array of almost golden tones mixed with light green leaves and creamy orange pistils. \\xa0It is extremely resinous and tends to leave an almost greasy feeling on the hands (when live, it feels almost like WD-40 sprayed on the fingers, then dries to a superglue-like tackiness after about 30 seconds) — the bag appeal is very high due to the thick trichome coverage and open structure. \\xa0Flower shape varies slightly depending upon phenotype, but they tend to be fairly slender but come to a rounded tip, often with a healthy \"crown\" of calyxes.\\n\\nAgain, it depends quite a bit upon phenotype what sort of aromas come out of this complex cross — however, most plants tend to have a unique citrus incense profile which tickles the nostrils, especially when freshly-ground. \\xa0Notes of sandalwood, tea, fuel, and softer floral notes all intermingle into what is a dream combination for many Sativa-lovers. \\xa0Pungent without being overwhelmingly stinky like the Giesel mom, this strain\\'s smell is both exotic and familiar while remaining very pleasant. \\xa0Some phenotypes do exhibit the pungent Chem end of the spectrum, with skunky chem-fuel elements which come in at varying amounts.\\n\\nThe taste mostly matches the aroma of the various phenotypes, with the Giesel-dominant examples normally having a more pungent aftertaste than a frontal taste and the opposite existing with the more lemony-incense Haze varieties. \\xa0A bit of hashiness creeps into the flavor at times simply due to the thick trichome coverage which is present, but the smoke is very smooth and not particularly expansive.\\n\\nNot a \"creeper\", the Isaac Haze quickly fills the user with a buzzing mental throughout both the mind and body as well as sending a burst of cycling pressure into the eyes and face. \\xa0It\\'s a strain which increases the overall mood as well as the activity level of the user, especially early on when the effects are at their strongest. \\xa0As it settles into the bulk of the duration, it becomes more of a smoothly functional Sativa, with a continued body presence that keeps the user feeling at-ease but mostly active. \\xa0Some of the more Giesel-dominant phenotypes hit a bit harder to the eyes and face and may cause a bit more mental fogginess, but even they don\\'t really inhibit function in all but the most detailed situations.\\n\\nA vigorous plant which responds well to netting and other low-stress training methods, this hybrid will product fairly large colas even if topped, continually reaching for the light despite having relatively close node spacing.\\n\\nUnknown — Giesel comes from the Massachusetts area, Bangi Haze has diverse origins\\n\\nBodhi Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n65 to 80 days depending upon phenotype (most finish around 70 days)\\n\\nSet apart by its supremely long duration, its sustained potency, impressive \"bag appeal\", and distinct pungent sweet citrus reek.

When broken up, it blows up into a wonderful combination of sweet citrus, soil, and pine that is truly pungent. A top-notch example of both facets of this strain\\'s signature aroma.\\n\\nLike a piña colada stirred with a pine branch, it was a combination of velvety citrus with a pine twang.\\n\\nAfter a short delay, the effects came on strongly — moments of staring off at nothing or deeply thinking about random subjects mingle into what amounts to a rather spacey experience to start. This strain was unique in that it kept up its potency for quite a long time, only dialing down slightly from its heady start as it went on. This I.S.S. became more apparent in the body as the minutes ticked by, relaxing the limbs quite a bit and warding off any aches and pains while maintaining a floaty brand of functionality. With occasional returns of the spaciness, this med provided a relaxing but functional ride that lingered for a really long time, eliminating the desire to re-medicate for nearly 4 hours.\\n\\nBritish Columbia\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant\\r\\n        \\n12-14 Weeks\\n\\nThis strain had elements of both parent strains evident in nearly all of its qualities, expressing the crisp, citrusy, cool elements of Jack Herer, and the kick of sweetness from Skunk. There were some flaws, but the harvest timing and trichome preservation made up for the hermie-induced tiny seeds that were spotted. This one was a great after-work unwinder type of med, that won\\'t completely knock you to the couch, but trended towards sedentary activities and a singular focus. Its potency was medium-high to start, but declined sharply at about 2 - 2.5 hours, placing it in the intermediate patient area.\\n\\r\\n            Jack Herer x Skunk #1\\r\\n        \\nSpearhead-shaped dingley green sepals, arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of mocha colored pistils, and average coverage with short hooked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nThe aroma mixed the best parts of both parent strains, with a citrus-kissed freshness coming from the Jack Herer and a heavy dose of sweetness from the Skunk. It reminded us of orange candy, and even a hint of gasoline-like sharp sweetness… its pungency wasn\\'t amazing, but it was definitely a strong aroma that gained pungency after being broken apart.\\n\\nMuch like the post-grind smell, the flavor was fresh, sweet, and sugary with some citrusy elements. The smoke also seemed to perfume the room, making it smell spicy and pleasant. A very smooth smoke, this one was easy on the throat and did not cause coughing with out staff, even those who have asthma. The final ash was a medium-light gray, showing the flush was sufficient.\\n\\nComing on quickly, after only a few hits, this one made us feel slightly light-headed (not in a bad way… more \\'floaty\\') but immediately calmed the nerves after a long day and placing us in a placid, peaceful mindset. Despite the inner calm, it did make our hearts race a bit to start, but that effect dissipated relatively quickly, at around 30-45 minutes, when the effects reached their peak. Though we felt a little spacey and couch-oriented randomly throughout the experience, it was calming enough to focus on one thing at a time, without being overtly sedative. We felt this one fell at near 50/50 Sativa/Indica in terms of effects… the second half was definitely on the relaxing side, but it never made us want to go to sleep.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nGreat stuff! High quality in every category. Its powerful cerebral buzz, mixed with a milder body high, has made this strain an up-and-coming contender for top medical strains.

Though not a super-pungent strain in general, this one was definitely noticed in the bag and increased in pungency when broken apart. Spicy citrus Haze smell gave way to a more smooth and outright sweet orange cream type of aroma after the grind, both of which we loved.\\n\\nWhile sharing qualities with both the pre and post-grind aroma, the flavor just fell short of those heights, giving more of a lightly sweet and floral, creamy orange flavor on the inhale, and a sharper more haze-like and spicy exhale. The flush seemed well-done, as the final ash was a fluffy light gray and white, and the smoke was very smooth throughout the experience.\\n\\nStarting mainly in the face and jaw area, the effects came on smoothly yet strongly, but never bordered on overwhelming. The immediate mental uplift that this strain brought had us ready to get into a variety of activities, while the relaxing body presence also made sitting very comfortable in stretches. We liked how smooth this strain feels, as it didn\\'t cause any heart-pounding or anxiety. It felt alternately Sativa and Indica, with some reviewers reporting more of an Indica effect later in the day and at higher dosages, while more Sativa effects seemed present at lower dosages and earlier in the day, in general. The effects took a decline at about an hour, but then stayed relatively constant through the end of the duration, seemingly disappearing with no after-effects.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA uniquely funky and long-lasting OG Kush hybrid\\n\\r\\n            [unknown]\\r\\n        \\nA pungent cash crop strain that was brought into the Northern California clone only scene from Oregon.\\xa0 THe most probable parentages are Light of Jah x OG Kush and Jack Herer x OG Kush; with it\\'s pungent aroma somewhat reminiscent of Light of Jah, this parentage is strongly suspected.\\n\\nBright green with burnt orange pistils and dense coverage with long, thin stalked trichomes with mid-sized heads.\\n\\nA strange \"garlic bud\" almost body odor citrus musk with notes of soil. You don\\'t really get a sense of that muskiness until it\\'s ground, at which point it becomes eye-watering pungent.\\n\\nPungent, earthy citrus bite - almost a skunky kush\\n\\nFeeling a little rushy to start, this strain was a little deceiving — a major rush of warmth and pressure into the eyes and head normally signals the beginning of a Sativa crush, but this one backed off after about 30 minutes and remained relatively calm throughout. Somewhat bleary-feeling eyes remained past the initial potency, but otherwise the effects moved mostly into the body while just providing a sense of calmness and a lazy mood elevation. The lingering effects lasted longer than many strains, but the initial potency was shorter than many… bit of a give and take there.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis is B-Real of Cypress Hill\\'s selected phenotype of OG Kush.\\n\\nOG Kush Phenotype\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWith is distinctive sweet-meets-bitter citrus flavor, and great structure, we give this Jilly Bean a hearty endorsement for patients seeking a relaxing yet mentally active experience. Its potent, but not-too-potent effects package was perfect for a relaxing day of sedentary work or unwinding in the evening. Patients who suffer from anxiety issues can find relief here, as this is a Sativa that will not cause panic or discomfort, even at higher dosages. This is a great example of the strain, and the strain itself is a unique and flavorful one — that makes for a wonderful combination.\\n\\r\\n            Orange Velvet x Space Queen\\r\\n        \\nAn exceptional example of a seed form with the orange punch flavor of Aeric77\\'s Cali O[range] bred by TGA/Subcool.\\xa0 The strain has experienced a resurgence in popurity thanks to the sweet citrus terpenes that it yields well in hash oil.\\n\\nSpade-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in loose stacked open calyxes, snaked with shocks of rich gold pistils, and above average coverage by long thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with slightly small heads\\n\\nThe main aroma is a very orange/grapefruit-heavy citrus scent, but the backing spiciness comes out post-grind, releasing an almost garlic-like quality that almost took over the citrus. While it wasn\\'t pungent in the realm of a Sour Diesel or something like that, it was very pungent for its type and even in a closed baggie could be detected from a few feet away, broadcasting its citrusy musk.\\n\\nThis one seemed to almost change at times, with some of us reporting a straight up orange drink (yep, like Tang) flavor, complete with the artificial quality of it all, while some got more of the spicy almost fuel-like qualities from the post-grind smell. The early hits tended to be more sweet, but left a bitter citrus oil taste lingering on the lips that hinted at the flavor of the later hits. This is an amazing orange strain though, most people will notice the similarities to the fruit immediately, whether it\\'s the smell or the taste.\\n\\nThe effects of this Jilly Bean were felt quickly and strongly, but it never got us to that racy or anxious state that some strong starters do, keeping us feeling mentally at-ease the entire time, though mentally energized. An increase in eye pressure (but not facial pressure) and a fluttery feeling in the chest were the early physical manifestations, but mentally it was definitely uplifting, greatly improving our mood and showing no outward signs of medication, making it a good professional/\"stealth\" type of strain. There was some visual enhancement as well, and in general, our senses felt very aware and acute. Despite the energy, most of us found that we spent most of our time sitting and smiling rather than being up and active — this is a relaxing Sativa overall, feeling much like a 50/50 hybrid as the lineage would indicate. During the last hour or so of effects, the Indica side came out more, and we felt very relaxed, with strong muscle relaxation and at times heavy eyes.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n55-65 Days\\n\\r\\n            Possibly a relative of the \"Planetary Kush\" line (exact lineage unknown)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nJuicy Fruit is a sativa-dominant hybrid thought to contain Thai genetics.

It was a bit overwhelming initially and left us feeling a bit self-conscious about our extremely medicated appearance, even in environments that were MMJ-friendly. Otherwise it was a good mid-day type of med for days when the stresses of life an/or daily aches and pains are getting to you — watch the dosage if you\\'re a newer patient though, as it can definitely get on top of you.\\n\\r\\n            Sweet Tooth x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\nNamed for the second tallest peak in the Himalayas. Not to be confused with the Dutch commercial strain named K2 of an entirely different lineage.\\n\\nA seriously pretty sample, this one has the structure/appearance that many of our staff prefers over all others, which is the well-defined, slightly loose one where you can see each calyx clearly and all the trichomes covering them. The blend of light, frosty green with the jack-o-lantern orange pistils gave it a classic look, but with an the thick covering of trichomes.\\n\\nThis one instantly vaulted itself into the upper-echelon of our staff\\'s \"Must Smell\" list — the uber-sweet \"blue candy\"-like smell also carried hints of oranges, strawberries and a grazzy/fresh quality one reviewer described as \"spring breeze\"… there was a tinge of cleaner in there too, like Formula 409. Pre-grind it was very pungent as well, with the ability to stink up a room when the jar/bag is opened — it was a stronger, sharper smell pre-grind as well, which was unique (it had notes of sweet curry, fall spices, and honey). Top notch smell here, simply put.\\n\\nAfter the smell being one of the high points of the last month or so (seriously, it smells that good), it was hard for the taste to live up to the billing, and that played out here. The dominant taste was a piney lime that has musky/sharp elements that brought to mind the OG part of the lineage… there was a sweetness present, but it wasn\\'t nearly as sweet as the smell. \\n\\nThis med seemed to hit our crew slightly different, with one reporting 75% Sativa effects, one reporting a 50/50 split, and another reporting 75% Indica-dominant feelings. It seems as if being in a different environment controls how the effects play out — reviewers were solitary seemed to have more of an Indica experience while others that were in work/social situations seemed to trend Sativa. Regardless, it started off with strong eye effects (not a stealth med at all), forehead/temple pressure, and ringing in the ears… seemed heavily Sativa at first. The potency was almost too much at times, especially for the work situations — moments of spacing out were common. Once the blast of initial potency moved on, the cloudy vision and eye effects contributed to a feeling of slight tiredness and fairly thorough mental/physical relaxation.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nOG Kush x Train Wreck (T4)\\n\\nAccording to the breeder, DNA Genetics, the goal with this cross was to combine the OG flavor with the Train Wreck bud structure. The OG Kush mother brings medical benefits and a tasty, pronounced terpene profile. The Train Wreck father brings high commercial yields, resin production, and lemony scents. The sweetness in the Kandy Kush is courtesy of the OG Kush female and is where the name stems from. This plant is known for its high resin production and is stated to be one of the most resinous in the entire DNA Genetics catalogue. This strain took 1st at the Colorado Cannabis Crown 2010 for best medical cannabis out of 140 strains.\\n\\nOnce again, this strain can vary greatly in appearance depending on the specific phenotype. The shape can range from more oblong-shaped like the Train Wreck to more circular-shaped like the OG; however, they are all dense – a characteristic of both parents. Given the sativa influence of the Train Wreck, nearly all phenotypes will have orange pistils but coverage density will vary. Kandy Kush produces a thick coat of resin, thus buds will appear ‘frosty’.\\n\\nWhile the variances in phenotype will apply to smell as well, Kandy Kush can generally be described as sweet, earthy, and piney. Some cuts will lean towards the OG Kush with distinct scents of sweet Pine Sol and lemons with a slight bite of fuel. Other cuts will lean towards the Train Wreck with scents of pine needles (herbal), flowers, and a slight bite of pepper.\\xa0\\n\\nBecause this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Kandy Kush generally has a sweet, piney, and pungent taste. The smoke is refreshing and keeps you coming back for more. Those growing from seed will have their choice of a variety of flavor profiles that can lean heavily towards one parent or the other. Those growing from clone should inquire as to the specifics of that particular cut.\\n\\nDepending on the particular mix of indica to sativa, this hybrid strain can be effective as either a daytime or a nighttime smoke. For many users, the sativa influence of the Train Wreck can overpower the heavier effects of the OG Kush.

It’s origins are in California, along with many other strains in the OG family: Tahoe OG, San Fernando Valley OG, and Ghost OG. In fact, one theory of the history of OG Kush holds that all of these cuts originated from the original strain and perhaps a treasured family heirloom in the woods of Northern California, near Lake Tahoe. The controversy lies in the authenticity of strains. Yet another claim argues that OG Kush comes from Chem Dog (Chem Dawg) lineage. This would place OG Kush back on the East Coast in Massachusetts. Both of these stories may have a connection even deeper in history though. Chemdog, the breeder, received a couple ounces of spectacular high-grade “chronic” from a couple of Colorado deadheads at the Deer Creek Amphitheatre in Indiana, 1991. The Colorado guys called it “Dog Bud” or “Chem Weed”. Back then, strains didn’t have so many names as they did grades. This was premier cannabis that was different from many types. The Coloradans believe that the weed that chemdog got seeds from was from somewhere on the Oregon, California border. It’s not crazy to believe that the two varietals came from the same mother plant in Northern California. Chemdog ‘91, one of the originals that produced some bag seeds and distributed around the country, has been bred into most popular strains today: Girl Scout Cookies, Gorilla Glue #4, Bubba Kush, the list goes on. If there is an “American strain”, it’s OG Kush. In particular, Larry OG is thought to be the original cut. As a member of Overgrown.com, a since discontinued website under speculation of drug distribution, Handle: Larry” cultivated this cut of OG Kush.\\n\\nLarry OG has bright green clusters of individual buds. In most indoor gardens, the buds don’t form grandiose colas but rather grow up several branches in small groupings with wide node space. Under natural outdoor conditions, OG Kush plants can form massive spherical bushes, resembling fruit or nut trees in less than 8 months\\n\\nOG Kush has a strong musky, skunk aroma with hints of bleach cleaner and citrus. The conditions for which this strain is grown largely determine the strength of the aroma. Connoisseur shops can be distinguished from the rest by having several authentic OG strains with slightly varied terpene profiles.\\n\\nTo the trained tongue, OG kush flavor is unparalleled and unique among all cannabis varieties. The skunky chemical aroma transfers into flavor among vaporization or smoking and rests on the palate for minutes. Low-moisture flowers may produce a harsher smoke. OG Kush is best consumed nearly fresh after harvesting or with an extremely gradual dry time. Thus, OG is known for its stickiness. Some claim that the grow conditions in California produce superior quality OG Kush, akin to sourdough bread in San Francisco, or a true New York pizza crust.\\n\\nNorthern California\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Super Skunk x Big Skunk Korean x Afghani Hawaiian\\r\\n        \\nBred by Soma to combine traits from international cannabis varieties and available in seed form.\\n\\nLavender is also known as \"Soma #10? and comes out of a varied mix of genetic lines that span the globe. \\n\\n The name comes from the finished color of the plant, the foliage of which often takes on deep purple, red, blue, and near-black colors before harvest.\\n\\nThe smell is much the same as the flavor, carrying a little bit of sweetness to go along with the incense-like, hashy notes.\\xa0\\n\\nThe bright colors don\\'t really translate to the flavor, which is a spicy and incense-like taste which brings to mind certain varieties of hash, along with flowers, and vegetation. \\n\\nSoma\\'s Lavender leans heavily towards its Afghani side in terms of effects, serving to deeply relax the user, creating a tranquil state of mind and deep body relaxation.\\xa0 \\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n8-9 Weeks\\n\\nThis strain fit very well into our daytime routines and pleased us with its distinctly floral elements which were present in both the aroma and flavor.

The combination of relaxation and mental uplift this strain offers had us feeling positive but smoothly relaxed for upwards of 3 hours, making this a great strain to medicate with mid-day and feel relief until early evening.

The name really makes sense once a whiff of the scent is detected, as it is ripe with flowery qualities and does bring to mind actual lavender. It\\'s like the Blueberry side of the family took a vacation and left the Haze at home to play, though there is a slight sweetness (some described it as \"purple, but not grapey\") underlying the Haze elements. It\\'s not the most pungent sample around, but it\\'s definitely noticeable in the jar, and becomes nicely pungent once broken apart.\\n\\nThe flowery, almost soapy Haze elements from the aroma came through strongly in the flavor, though it wasn\\'t quite as pleasing to our tastes as it was in aroma form for whatever reason. It has a light sweetness to it, but it was mostly present on the initial inhale, changing quickly to the more floral flavor that remained until the aftertaste. The smoke was light and crisp in the mouth, hitting smoothly and not really causing coughing except on some large hits. The final ash was a fluffy medium-light gray, showing it had received a proper flush.\\n\\nThis strain is somewhat unique in that it seemed to come on as more of an Indica to start, relaxing us and knocking us down a peg slightly, then transitioning into a more uplifting and Hazy effect after about 30 minutes. We felt that this one put us in a meditative state where we could function and work, but it carried a bit of signature Haze spaciness that had us walking around in circles at times, enjoying some of the psychoactivity it offered. The smooth effects peaked around 45 minutes, then gradually declined from there, lingering out to over 3 hours for most of our staff.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nLegend\\'s OG x (ChemDawg x Skunk VA)\\n\\nLegend\\'s OG x (ChemDawg x Skunk VA)\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nTrichomes begin to amber at 9 weeks. \\n\\nHighly sought after in the concentrate scene, Lemon G13, or Lemon G, is a profound aromatic experience and carries one of the most citrus-heavy terpene profiles of all known cannabis strains.\\n\\nLemon Haze x G13\\n\\nArm sized colas are common at harvest time and is a notoriously \"tough trim\" with many grouch finger length water leaves. \\n\\nProfoundly cerebral.

The warming body sensation was appreciated, as it started almost immediately and also ccontributed to the improved demeanor. After this initial period of uplift, this strain seemed to drop us down into a heavy state of relaxation where the core was heavy and warm but the limbs were mobile and active.

Though we would\\'ve liked more peak potency, it still had quite a bit of medicinal value, especially through the first 1.5 hours — but even past that, it left a lingering relaxation that aided sleep a great deal. Its appearance and smell were both above-average, though the smell was somewhat tame for a Kush, lacking some of the acrid notes that many of them have (which is a good thing for many people).\\n\\r\\n            Master Kush x Empress Kush\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Bred by Cabin Fever Seeds\\n\\nTeardrop-shaped sage green calyxes with maroon pistils, and long thin-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nThis OG had a fresh, sweet, perfumey, spicy, slightly fruity aroma that was easily noticed from several feet away but wasn\\'t ever overbearing. After grinding, some sharpness came out and it increased in pungency further, releasing an aroma that had a rubbery sting that you often find in Diesel strains.\\n\\nMuch like the smell, the taste was on the light side of the OG spectrum, bringing more of a spicy and barely sweet taste that didn\\'t carry any of the sharpness. It got rather smoky and nutty-tasting after the initial hits, but was never unpleasant. \\n\\nThis was a rather smooth-feeling OG experience, coming on easily and slowly over the first 15 minutes. Other than the eyelids lowering and some redness, there were not many physical head effects to start — however, the body felt warm and relaxed despite the heart beating a little faster than normal initially. An elevated but not euphoric mood made us feel calm and productive when consumed in the daytime, very relaxed and ready for bed when consumed late at night. It lost a lot of its power at 1-1.5 hours, but though the overt effects died down, the mental and physical relaxation continued.\\n\\nCalifonia\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n60-67 Days\\n\\r\\n            A long-finishing Indica-dominant hybrid coming from the Matanuska Valley of Alaska, this particular one was given to Sagarmatha seeds by growers in the area.\\xa0 Known for its large fan leaves and big yields along with its Sativa-like effect, it\\'s a very unique example of a near-landrace variety from North America.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Alaskan hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Strains from the area have been known for years as very potent and productive, one famous specimen got the name Alaskan (sometimes Matanuskan) Thunderfuck and has been circulated around in clone form since the 1980\\'s.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            An interesting blend of musky dark chocolate-like smells and notes of citrus. \\n\\r\\n            Musky lemon, sometimes heavier on one or the other. \\n\\r\\n            Matanuska Tundra is generally an uplifting strain, seeming more like a Sativa than the Indica it shows in its growth patterns.\\xa0 It\\'s a big time mood elevator, relieving stress and anxiety as well as easing daily aches and pains — recommended as a medical strain for beginner to moderate users, as it lacks the top-shelf type of modern day potency. \\n\\r\\n            It grows rather short and forms a very strong main cola and numerous side branches — with training, it can work for a compact SCROG setup, but generally it works best as a bush.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Matanuska Valley, Alaska, USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sagarmatha Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Long for an Indica, the tops can continue flowering for 115+ days if allowed, but the rest of the plant ripens in the 70 day area.\\r\\n        \\n[MERGE WITH \"Maui Wowie\" RECORD]\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid - Sativa Dominant\\r\\n        \\nThe best Maui Waui we\\'ve had the pleasure of trying, and it was certainly the most sativa-looking.

The effects were perfect for an after-work uplift leading into early bedtime.

Once ground, it released a stronger incense-like aroma that seemed to be a magnification of the previous floral elements. Though it was nicely pungent right after being ground up and even in the jar, it dissipated quickly from there. Not an amazingly pungent smell, but it combined smells from the spicy/floral/incense area with the more standard sweet berry in a unique way.\\n\\nThe taste was a less distinct and pronounced version of the smell, with the same blend of floral and berry elements, but with a mentholated quality that almost seemed to make it less pungent. However, what flavor was there seemed to last for some time in the session, even as gray ash was beginning to form.\\n\\nComing on fairly quickly (within 5 minutes), the early effects of this strain felt heavily Sativa for sure, giving us a package of head effects including light pressure which felt like a buzzing \"finger\" poking into the forehead, and a general uplift in mental energy. Along with this came a definite uptick in heart rate and a light-feeling body that felt freed from many of the muscle aches and light pains of the day. Feeling capable and energetic, we found ourselves organizing things or simply enjoying the seemingly heightened sense of hearing, which had us picking up all manner of tiny sounds and processing them all at once. After the initial hour or so, the effects began to become much more relaxing, though the direct muscle relaxing quality that was present at first decreased in strength — the eyes felt dry and tired, increasing the tired feeling. We felt slightly lethargic at times, and overall, we found the comedown and later effects to be a little drowsy and typical of a Sativa \"crash\".\\n\\nCanada\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid, soil-grown\\r\\n        \\n63-70 Days\\n\\nChemDawg D x Tang Tang males\\n\\nOne of the most trichome-laden strains we\\'ve ever seen at KindReviews, Mob Boss (especially the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes) is absolutely covered with trichomes, from fan leaf stems to the tip of the large colas. \\xa0This distinctive appearance and very stout density makes its \"bag appeal\" off the charts for most patients, eliciting \"wow\"s from all but the most jaded connoisseurs. \\xa0When growing, the different phenotypes will be readily-apparent due to their differences in smell, but the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes will be taller and will have a stronger, pointed central cola while the Chem D phenos will chunk up a bit more but stay shorter with rounded-top colas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn herbal-citrus aroma is the predominant one before the strain is broken apart — the Tang Tang side of the family is not known for its scent. Once broken apart, it displays a hint of the sharpness from the Chem D, but is still largely vegetal and citrusy. \\xa0The Chem D-dominant phenotypes will have a much sharper aroma with elements of the notorious chemical-skunk-citrus funk of the mother, but the Tang Tang still tends to tone the whole \\xa0package down slightly from the original D.\\n\\nLike the smell, it\\'s not the most pungent thing around, tasting of herbal citrus with hashy notes in the background and a thick, expansive smoke. \\xa0Again, the Chem D phenotypes have a more assertive flavor and a lingering aftertaste of chem.\\n\\nThanks to the Tang Tang influence, this strain isn\\'t nearly as heavy or overtly potent as the ChemDawg D, which is a good thing for many patients who still like to be productive during their day. \\xa0The couchy yet cerebral D influence is still felt though, especially in the second half of the experience (most strongly in the Chem-dominant phenotypes). \\xa0The Tang Tang phenos tend to be very clear-headed and smoothly uplifting, feeling like a moderate Sativa — the different expressions of this plant definitely deliver different effect packages. \\xa0Despite its absolutely ridiculous appearance, Tierra Rojo refers to this strain as a bit of a \"show pony\" in that it doesn\\'t quite live up to the insane potency that the looks promise. \\xa0Still, it\\'s above-average in potency and delivers a balanced effect which aids with muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and often gives a boost of energy as well (Tang Tang plants especially).\\n\\nThe Tang Tang adds vigor and yield to the Chem D and branches well, making this a superb plant for SCROG methods, as it will produce large colas on well-trained side branches and continues growing more dense into the final week. \\xa0This plant seems to give the best combination of yield and quality when grown in a coco-based medium and fed heavily — the trichome production displayed from week 3 on is astounding and the Mob Boss tends to look like the \"whitest\" plant in almost any room due to the fan leaves being caked with densely-packed thin-headed trichomes. \\xa0The Tang Tang phenos will have more pointed colas while the Chem D will be more rounded and blocky at the tops.\\n\\nCalifornia, USA\\n\\nGrindhouse Medical Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n60 to 70 days depending upon phenotype\\n\\r\\n            Dinafem chose their two best clones of White Widow and Haze and crossed them, likely using the colloidial silver sex-reversal process in order to create male flowers on female plants, thus producing feminized seed stock.\\xa0 White Widow is known for its power and trichome production, well Haze is renowned for its soaring, cerebral effect — combining the two produces a Sativa-dominant plant which ups the frostiness of the Haze, lessens the flowering time, but still retains much of the Haze flavor and aroma.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            White Widow x Haze\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Like a sweet Haze, carrying notes of flowers, citrus, vanilla, and tropical fruits — very appealing. \\n\\r\\n            Flowery (even soapy), the Haze seems to come through more clearly in the flavor than the smell — it\\'s not quite as sweet but still carries the same \"smooth\" qualities of vanilla and eucalyptus. \\n\\r\\n            With a typical rush of Sativa effects starting things off (lots of eye/head/face pressure, a marked increase in heart rate), the Haze part of the equation announces itself quickly.\\xa0 Very cerebral, even influencing vision a bit, this strain takes the user on a bit of a mental ride early on.\\xa0 After the initial effects die off about 1 hour into the experience, it shifts gears, apparently bringing more of the White Widow influence to the table — a floaty, relaxed state that could easily lead into sleep finished things off.\\xa0 This strain is recommended highly for its \"up then down\" experience as an evening med, as it will leave the user relaxed and ready for sleep after about 3 hours. \\n\\r\\n            There are two common phenotypes in Moby Dick, one that is heavily Sativa-dominant and carries more of the spicy, floral, incense Haze taste and smell.\\xa0 The other pheno has slightly more Indica influence and the final product is sweeter.\\xa0 Dinafem recommends keeping the pH below 6.5 at all times to avoid iron deficiencies and keeping the EC around 1.5 - 2, as it it a rather heavy feeder and generally gets large.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Feminized seed stock available from Dinafem Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            60 - 70 days\\r\\n        \\nThis hybrid stunned the world when it won the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam for the \"Best Seed Company Sativa\" after being entered by first-time competitor Rare Dankness Seeds.

the Trainwreck which makes certain areas of the buds look almost gray at times (especially the underside of leaves).\\n\\nThe scent definitely seems to be Amnesia Haze-dominant, with a lightly citrusy, sweet, fresh aroma that is easily-noticed as soon as the jar is opened, though it\\'s more of a \"what\\'s that lovely smell?\" as opposed to \"whew, what stinks?\" situation. \\xa0When ground apart, its already strong pungency increases further, bringing out a slight sandalwood/spice haziness which adds complexity to the exceedingly pleasant, floral Amnesia smell. \\xa0This strain brings to mind several of the best things about Haze, and lovers of that genetic line will undoubtedly find something to their liking here.\\n\\nSweet and floral elements are most prevalent on the inhale, but the hint of citrus comes out on the exhale, leaving a lingering Haze note on the palate. \\xa0The smoke perfumes the smoke perfumes the room like most good Haze tends to do and is very smooth on the throat and not particularly expansive.\\n\\nStarting off with a near-immediate boost of internal energy and a buzzing sensation throughout the head and body, this sativa definitely feels as such early on. \\xa0Mood is elevated, sensory perception seems heightened, and the mind becomes very active, if a little bit jumpy and frantic at times. \\xa0It\\'s not a very \"facial\" strain, only providing a little bit of eye and face buzzing early in the duration, residing primarily in the brain instead. \\xa0After the stimulating initial effects have subsided a bit (normally around the 1 to 1.5 hour mark), it becomes a wonderfully care-free yet clear-headed sativa which doesn\\'t drop mood or \"crash\" at the end, but rather keeps the user on an even mental keel and fully able to function. \\xa0This is a great daytime choice for stimulating the mind and body and generally improving the tone of the day.\\n\\nScott [at time of original print] primarily grows in a very regimented hydroponic setup, and these plants are no exception. \\xa0As they take a long time to flower, it\\'s advisable to flip lighting to 12/12 when they\\'re under 18 unless high ceilings are available. \\xa0The plant responds well to SCROG techniques and will form a large footprint rather easily due to the\\xa0candelabra-like side branching imparted by the Trainwreck.\\n\\nColorado, USA\\n\\nRare

Sativa-dominant strain effect, smell, and taste-wise, but still manages a short flowering time thanks to the addition of a secret unknown Indica with \"maple leaf\" traits.\\xa0 The taste and smell seem to model themselves after the Jack Herer and/or Haze in most cases, giving off a spicy and lemony bouquet.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Unknown hybrid containing Jack Herer, Haze, and an unknown Indica supposedly related to Juicy Fruit\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Mentholated citrus and pine with a spicy lean, very much like Jack Herer itself. \\n\\r\\n            Much like the smell, it\\'s a citrus-dominant Haze taste with some spicy pine elements and a mentholated, cool quality. \\n\\r\\n            Very cerebral and spacey, this strain definitely calls upon its Haze lineage with its effects package.\\xa0 Uplifting and somewhat energetic, it is a powerful strain that doesn\\'t leave mental processes unscathed — some distraction and spacing out is inevitable with this one.\\xa0 Lots of face and eye pressure occurs with this strain as well, making it appropriate for those suffering from ocular issues.\\xa0 Once the cerebral Sativa start died down, it got slightly relaxing and more sedate towards the end, uplifting mood and making for a smooth ride back to a normal state. \\n\\r\\n            Most phenotypes of this strain get rather tall and show Haze-dominant growth structure yet finish in a reasonable amount of time.\\xa0 There are some Indica-dominant phenos that work well for SOG, but otherwise this is more of a SCROG type plant that responds reasonably well to training.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sensi Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n

hashy, with a spicy hint \\n\\nStrongly sedative, this strain is best for evening use.\\xa0 Its rising body effect leaves the user feeling warm and vibrating, helping to ease muscle tension and pain.\\xa0 Though not as strong as some modern day hybrids, this strain is a good choice for a moderate Indica user who likes a traditional hashy Afghani taste. \\n\\nGrows stout with a strong single

We never expected all that much from the flavor and smell of the strain for that reason, and that basically shook out the way we expected, with none of us really finding those elements remarkable. However, we all felt that the effects were superb, especially given that it outlasted most strains in terms of medicinal-level potency and overall duration. This is a perfect strain for a day off at home or an evening after a tiring day of work, serving to deeply relax the mind and body and relieve most pains. It didn\\'t really elevate our mood, but put it us in a contemplative, at-ease state that would be conducive to activities such as yoga or meditation.\\n\\r\\n            Fort Collins Cough x Northern Lights #5\\r\\n        \\nThe Fort Collins Cough mother is a beloved Colorado clone-only strain Northern Lights #5 x Haze #17\\n\\nClaw-shaped forest green sepals, arranged in loose open stacked calyxes, with sparse russet brown pistils, and above average coverage thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with larger than average heads\\n\\n While not a smell that will really impress anyone, this strain smelled much like we would expect, given the lineage. It was lightly citrusy, with a spicy, hashy background that increased in pungency when ground or broken up. It essentially smelled to us like Colorado Cough with less of the Haze qualities.\\n\\nLike the smell, the flavor wasn\\'t overtly pungent or noteworthy in terms of appeal. We got some lightly floral flavors that brought to mind hibiscus tea and some light citrus overtones, but otherwise it was mostly earthy and a bit smoky. One thing that we all liked about this strain is how smooth it was, never really making us cough due to either harshness or expansion — great choice for those who love a smooth smoking experience.\\n\\nThis was the area where this strain really shined, after a middling performance in the smell and taste areas. The initial effects of this strain came on strongly, but seemed to increase in potency further over the first 30 minutes or so. A \"facial mask\" pressure feeling, slightly reddened eyes, and what one reviewer referred to as a \"glazing euphoria\" overtook us, immediately taking hold of our mental focus and leaving us a bit detached from the world. The senses seemed open and aware, but the brain was a bit slow at handling the sensory inputs. Body-wise, there was a strong relaxation happening in the neck and shoulder area after the first hour especially, which served to kill off upper back pain and gave us a feeling similar to just coming out of a sauna. the slight mental stupor (it was described positively as a \"meditative state\") combined with the deep body relaxation made the second half of this experience superb for a quiet evening at home rather than out and about. A long, steady dwindle of effect left us ready for sleep by the end.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA veritable melting pot of genetic lines, this hybrid is as unpredictable as its lineage would indicate.\\xa0 When finished, it produces dense spear-shaped nugs that glimmer with trichomes and bright orange pistils.\\n\\nBlueberry x Northern Lights #5 x Trainwreck x BOGBubble\\n\\nGiving off a not particularly noticeable piney scent in the container, it turns into a lovely lemony-fertilizer burst of freshness when broken into. \\n\\nSome lightly sweet lemon blends with oddly spicy juniper \\n\\nThe effects of this strain are hard to pin down despite it being rather potent.\\xa0 It starts out with a racy set of Sativa effects that brings to mind the Trainwreck part of its lineage — a racing heart, some perspiration, and lots of facial ad ocular pressure cycling.\\xa0 Once that introductory state passed, it was a uniquely visual and cerebral experience, lending itself to solitary creative situations more than social ones.\\xa0 To finish it often comes with a fairly heavy crash, leaving the user lethargic, heavy-eyed, and ready for bed. \\n\\nColorado, USA\\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA strongly Indica hybrid of two classic Amsterdam commercial hybrids, this strain was actually bred in Denver, Colorado.\\xa0 Short-flowering and stocky, it will generally form a strong main cola if left untopped.\\xa0 Both parent strains are known for being easy to grow and mold/pest-resistant, so this is a good beginner strain.\\n\\nNorthern Lights #5 x Ice\\n\\nFloral, spicy, and lightly skunky \\n\\nHints of grapefruit — piney citrus with a spicy bent and an earthy aftertaste \\n\\nA fairly strong starter, this strain is rather relaxing physically but also has quite a strong Skunk-influenced head effect.\\xa0 It\\'s not too potent to inhibit function, but it\\'s definitely a nighttime type of strain due to its relaxing comedown, which leads easily into sleep.\\xa0 It aids with muscle relaxation, gives a mood uplift, helps with minor pain, and increases appetite, making it a solid choice for patients who desire a relaxing Indica. \\n\\nBoth parent strains bred in Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\n\\nUnknown\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWould assume 50-55 days based on lineage\\n\\nA stout, disease and mold-resistant plant with dark green, broad leaves, it seems apparent that Northern Lights is Afghani in origin.\\xa0 There are several varieties of Northern Lights that worked their way into breeding stock for Sensi Seeds.\\xa0 Northern Lights #1 is rare these days and was the taller and frostier selection with a fresh scent; Northern Lights #2 is more stout, piney-smelling, and very mite-resistant; Northern Lights #5 is the most popular, potent, and vigorous one; and Northern Lights #9 is a super-rare cut once held by Nevil Schoenmaker that was used to breed and then disappeared.\\nWith its longstanding history and popularity, Northern Lights is in high-demand in most legal cannabis markets. Since it can be hard to come by at the dispensary, many home growers enjoy cultivating Northern Lights. Selecting the right marijuana seeds is important when cultivating Northern Lights and growers who want consistent results should look for feminized Northern Lights seeds to ensure a reliable harvest.\\n\\nThought to be of Afghani lineage, from the \"Basic #5? line\\n\\nSee above — originated with the Super Sativa Seed Club, the earliest of the major seed banks.\\xa0 It\\'s since worked its way into hundreds of hybrids, making it one of the foundations of modern cannabis genetics.\\n\\nPiney and earthy, at times lightly sweet \\n\\nPiney, hashy, and earthy \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVery relaxing and indica-dominant effect, at times able to induce sleep.\\xa0 A heavy head, heavy eyelids, and a smile are the main effects of this strain, making it a great nighttime selection.\\n\\nGrows well in hydro or soil, staying rather short and forming a single strong cola.\\xa0 Great for SOG applications, it\\'s also a low odor plant that\\'s easy to grow for beginners thanks to its stature and disease/pest-resistance.\\n\\nPacific Northwest of the USA, later to Amsterdam\\n\\nOriginally created as \"Basic #5? by the Super Sativa Seed Club, the precursor to Sensi Seeds — later was sold by Sensi itself\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n45-50 days\\n\\r\\n            Crossing the stout and sturdy NL #5 with a tall and rangy Thai produces a result with hybrid vigor and a sweet-sour smell.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Northern Lights #5 x Thai\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sweet berry with a backing chemical pine sharpness \\n\\r\\n            Earthy, spicy, and sweet \\n\\r\\n            A smooth blend of Indica and Sativa qualities, it\\'s overall rather uplifting, enhancing creativity and improving mood a great deal.\\xa0 Some body relaxation attributes from the NL #5 parent come through later in the duration, working to relieve pain as well. \\n\\r\\n            Unknown\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            A combination of two old-school classics, Northern Skunk is an easy-to-grow plant with a high calyx-to-leaf ratio and a relaxing, sedative effect.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Northern Lights x Skunk #1\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Lightly sweet aroma with hints of pine \\n\\r\\n            Hashy and earthy \\n\\r\\n            Relaxing and sedative, it eases both the mind and body.\\xa0 Good for general relaxation, muscle tension, appetite, and sleep. \\n\\r\\n            Stays short and forms a strong single cola, making it good for SOG applications.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Versions offered by Ceres Seeds and World of Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            55-60 days\\r\\n        \\nOne of the most popular and potent strains in the world, the OG Kush family is known for its pungent lemon, fuel, skunk, and spice scent/taste spectrum.\\xa0 The effects vary but almost always induce a sense of calm focus, never making the mind too cloudy, but still giving it a wake-up call with the potency.\\n\\nUnknown, there are many cuts with differing history and lineage\\n\\nUSA\\n\\nThere are a large variety of clone-only OG Kush strains and many seed companies have released \"s1? versions of the cuts and crosses containing them.\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThe smell and taste for this one were absolutely top-notch — a great fusion of the two parent strains.

The in-mouth taste was soil-heavy, with some citrus elements. On exhalation, a lingering aftertaste of gun oil and fuel complete this complex and pungent taste package.\\n\\nQuickly the face feels pressure fluctuations, the eyes lower, and waves of energy are felt throughout the body — there was some \"butterflies\" feeling and a little heart-racing to start. After that passed, it felt fairly functional mentally, but the body was reluctant to do much more than enjoy a seat and it took on a fairly direct Indica quality. Even that initial wave of potency wasn\\'t all that strong though, and this was a manageable medication overall, making it suitable for many situations, whether they be social, solitary, or a little of both.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nOG Kush x Sour Diesel x C-99\\n\\nOG Kush x Sour Diesel x C-99\\n\\nCompared with other OG\\'s, the Cindy 99 crossed into the OG Sin gives a highly motivated, thought provoking and creative high. \\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nTwo great strains mixed - looks alright, smells great, and it\\'s potent too!\\n\\r\\n            OG Kush x Sweet Tooth\\r\\n        \\nArrowhead-shaped clover green sepals, arranged in closed stacked calyxes, with patches of golden brown pistils, and above average coverage with wavy average-stalked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nFairly sweet, where the kush was actually overpowered in this cross though still clearly evident.

Zone looks extremely Indica in almost every way, from the dark coloration to the fat trichome heads, and the taste and smell carried that trend through, with a package of spicy, musky, and earthy qualities. We felt that the effects seemed to depend upon context a bit, as a morning review produced more of a moderate Indica hybrid experience, and a later session resulted in a more overt Indica feeling, with only the first 30 minutes to 1 hour feeling energizing or stimulating. The sleep aid properties that ended this experience were perhaps its greatest medical benefit, but the main effects serves to elevate mood a bit while helping with daily aches and tensions. Oh! Zone had a potent start that might be a little much for inexperienced patients, so we\\'d mark this in the mid-level patient category, primarily for evening use.\\n\\r\\n            UBC Chemo x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\nBred by Canada\\'s Doctor Greenthumb Seeds\\n\\nArrowhead-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight stacked calyxes, snaked with shocks of rust colored pistils, and above average coverage with short thin-stemmed trichomes with large heads.\\n\\nThough this isn\\'t an appealing smell in the sense that something fruity or sweet is, it appealed to the Indica-lovers in our staff, who recognized the musky, woody, spicy, earthy aromas it released as harbingers of a traditional type of Indica experience. It was a bit softer and more straight musky with slight pepper notes in the bag/jar, but when ground, it became sharper and a tad garlicky, with hints of pine and a major uptick in pungency level.\\n\\nMuch like the pre-grind smell, the flavor was a spicy, vegetal, and earth-dominant experience, never tasting particularly distinct. The smoke was fairly pleasant and only made us cough on large hits due to expansion. The flavor did degrade to the point where it wasn\\'t pleasurable by the end, but that\\'s fairly standard amongst strains that aren\\'t overtly flavorful from the outset. \\n\\nThe initial effects of this strain, like many, seemed fairly Sativa in nature, serving to awaken us quite a bit just by changing the mental state slightly and causing physical effects in the head, face, and eyes along with the urge to move around in the seat or get up and walk around. We got some typical pressure increase in the facial areas as well as a cascading/waving body effect that was mostly concentrated in the neck, shoulders, and upper torso. An increased heartrate and some spatial distortion had us slightly overwhelmed at times early on, but that cleared up after about 30 minutes. The early energized effect evened out into a relaxing but somewhat cloudy-feeling mental state, where tasks could be accomplished, but tended to move more slowly and deliberately than normal. One reviewer amongst our group who reviewed in the morning hours found it to be not nearly as heavy, and the initial effects seemed to carry the energy level into the 2nd hour — the rest of us had a more short-lived \"up\" part of the experience. Relaxation builds after the first 1.5 hours or so, culminating in an outright sleepy state as it left us.\\n\\nCanada\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n55-65 Days\\n\\nOJ Ghost is a terrific example of an uplifting hybrid cannabis strain.\\n\\r\\n            Orange Juice Bud x Ghost\\'s OG\\r\\n        \\nBred by Obsoul33t, a master sure to leave his mark on both the underground his moniker reminds you of and the industry sure to produce copious amounts of his flower, the OJ Ghost stems from a pack of seeds gifted in Gaberville, CA in 1988. \\xa0One lone male was found...and we thank our lucky stars it was bred to multiple elite clone-only strains. \\xa0This particular cross is with Ghost\\'s OG Kush, one of the orginal OG\\'s known for being one of the best illustrations of the OG hybrid nature, and one of KindReviews\\' all-time favorite cannabis varietals.\\n\\nThe dry bud is very conical in nature with medium to small calyx/sepal size. \\xa0The pistils tend to brown quickly and easily and assist in adding a rust color to the generally orange hue of the flower. \\xa0The OG side of the plant offers a distinct lime green coloration to the flower as well as the tendency to go slight purple and other darker hues while in late flower prior to harvest. \\xa0She is a beautiful plant and can easily be picked out of a garden, or at least isolated to the family of OJB ladies.\\n\\nAs with all of the OJB crosses, the orange peel aroma is absolutely demonstrative! \\xa0Unlike the familiar Tangerine Haze and Tangie lines which have softer, muted orange (citrus) scents, this family line brings childhood soccer game orange peel smells right to your face.\\n\\nUpon intial inhale or dry puff the orange dominance makes its mark, but exhale of the smoke leaves a wonderful OG pinene flavor across the tongue and roof of mouth.\\n\\nThe general nature of the high is quite similar to the mild mannered OG Kush line (not the heavier handed and indica dominant varieties like Skywalker OG, Hells Angels OG or even Face-Off OG) with a clear pep towards the euphoric sativa side of things thanks to the OJB terpene profile. \\xa0While clearly not a skyrocketing sativa by any stretch, the OJ Ghost has an uplifting attitude beyond the OG family that can be appreciated any time of day.\\xa0\\n\\nCalifornia, USA -

The smell/taste package was average but enjoyable enough not to hamper anything. The real star here though are the effects, which were blindingly potent at first, but dropped off to a very useful state of focused functionality. Some body attributes were present later on in the duration, but overall, this was a \"heady\" med that is best-suited for mental energy, mood, and ocular relief.\\n\\nIsland Sweet Skunk x Trinity\\n\\nFat spade-shaped olivine sepals, arranged in stacked spiral calyxes, with frequent bursts of copper pistils, and above average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nNot exactly appealing in the sense that you want to smell it regularly, this strain was a combination of a slightly creamy vegetal sweetness along with a more putrid, fecal, \"cheese\" type of smell that made us wrinkle our collective nose. It hints at potency, but isn\\'t terribly appealing to most people. The smell also weirdly seemed to disappear after a grinding rather than getting stronger.\\n\\nMuch like the smell, the taste wasn\\'t terribly appealing but wasn\\'t bad either — it gave off a light, spicy citrus with some smooth, almost creamy notes present along with a floral (one reviewer said \"soapy\") quality. Contrary to many strains, this one seemed to taste better when you really go at it with the lighter rather than \\'sipping\\' it, filling the mouth with a floral-tinged smoke.\\n\\nA very heavy and nearly overwhelming Sativa experience started this one off — the brow sweated, the heart rate jumped, and a rising pressure filled the brow/forehead/eye area. Mentally it had us full of energy but a bit spaced-out, at least initially. The initial potency only lasted about 30 minutes (probably a good thing, it was a little much even for our veteran review staff), fading into a focused state where we found ourselves swept up in a single task that seemed to go on unabated for hours. Though not exactly couchlocked, that was basically the end result, as the singular focus on sedentary work/activities kept us engaged throughout. Some enduring head pressure was the last physical remnant of this med, and it faded out cleanly with only a little bit of a drained feeling.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWe really enjoyed this sample after not being overly excited to try it based on our experiences with Mango and its family in the past, as well as the reputation of Nirvana Seeds for putting out variations on other seedbank product. However, this particular Papaya really impressed us with its strong and lasting Indica-dominant effects which had us glued to the couch, but enjoying every minute of it. The musky and complex fruit smell and flavor really reminded us of Mango at times, and that added to the overall appeal.\\n\\r\\n            Citral x Ice\\r\\n        \\nBred by Nirvana Seeds to be a fast growing and disease resistant strain.\\n\\nClaw-shaped cucumber green sepals, arranged in tight cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of paarl brown pistils, and average coverage with short wavy trichomes with large heads\\n\\nThis strain had a fruity and slightly musky smell to it which did indeed bring to mind mangoes, down to the complex-smelling skin with its musky qualities, which seemed to mostly be present pre-grind. Once it was ground, it took on a more directly sweet and floral fruity quality, keeping the mango scent mostly intact. This was a rather uncanny-smelling fruit strain, and one that impressed us, given that we had not really heard much about it in the past.\\n\\nLightly sweet and fruity, the flavor was similar to the smell, but not quite as directly fruity, with more of an earthy bent on the inhale, converting to an almost peppery, spicy funk on the exhale. This complex-tasting strain certainly had tropical fruit elements, but it was mostly reminiscent of the earthy, spicy, and lightly fruity Afghani lines. The flavor was pleasantly sweet until mid-way though the bowl, but the smoke was also rather thick and expansive, causing some coughing at times.\\n\\nThough we did feel some Sativa effects such as a major increase in heart rate, this sample felt heavily Indica, though it was nicely functional at smaller dosages. The initial potency seemed to last a long time, keeping up at a high level through 1.5 hours, mostly putting us in a couchlocked state where the body literally felt heavy and pulled down but the mind was fairly active and engaged when prompted. Strong pain relief and muscle relaxation had our bodies feeling rather floppy and the waves emanating from the solar plexus kept up at a high level for almost an hour. A lasting euphoric feeling was the main mental effect we experienced, and we just generally felt very good the entire time we were medicated on this strain. As the effects cleared, we lifted ourselves off of the couch and regained some of our ability to focus, and there were no real lingering tired feeling or other negative side effects.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\r\\n            Seed\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n49-63 Days\\n\\r\\n            Combining the best of both worlds, this strain contains the heavily Indica-dominant Pez and the highly Sativa Haze, making this a near-balanced hybrid.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Pez (Afghani x Pakistani) x Haze\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Lightly sweet citrus-pine \\n\\r\\n            Sweetness, and some spicy citrus qualities present from the Haze \\n\\r\\n            The effect is mostly heady, seemingly getting much of its influence from the Haze father.\\xa0 Cerebral and relaxing, it won\\'t leave you completely incapacitated mentally, but definitely a little slower than normal. \\n\\r\\n            USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA stout, bushy plant that grows squat and strong. \\xa0Thick wide leaves of hand size or larger cover the plant.\\n\\r\\n            [Cherry Pie x Grand Daddy Purple (GDP)] x Bay Platinum Cookies\\r\\n        \\nBred and released by the GDP Crew out of California, the exact genetics are a bit hazy online. \\xa0Many of the seedbanks have it clearly listed as simply the Cherry Pie x GDP but forums dating back to the original list have additional Platinum Cookies or Bay Cookies in the mix.\\n\\nDark purple and even black leaves adorn this plant in flower.

We saw huge potential in the smell/flavor package, which reminded us of some of our favorite fruity Hazes — but the iffy trim, overall \"blah\" visual appearance, and lack of visual trichomes knocked it down a peg. The effects were definitely Sativa-dominant, with a familiar Haze-influenced dream-like effect and some moderate muscle and mental relaxation. We sort of vacillated between active and sedative states, making the medical uses once again a little confusing and varied. We see this as a late daytime type of med for patients who want to retain functionality and energy but can still use a mental vacation.\\n\\nUnknown\\n\\nLong, thin spearhead shaped palm green calyxes, formed in loose closed clusters, with dark goldenrod pistils, and above average density of average-stalked trichomes with small heads\\n\\nThis strain really reminded our crew of something from the Jack Herer line, as it had that familiar (yet sweeter, more in the Jack Flash vein) citrus Haze aroma that we all love — another reviewer mentioned Dutch Durban as another similar aroma profile. It was certainly noticeable in the jar, but it really developed when it was handled or ground up, getting a little more aggressive and taking on an almost Diesel-like backing musk that competed with the sweetness for attention.\\n\\nGiving off a rather thick smoke, this strain mostly matched its aroma in the flavor, bringing a slightly more floral, eucalyptus-influenced flavor with many of the same citrus elements. It left a pleasantly hashy aftertaste in the mouth, and the actual flavor maintained well as it burned away. As mentioned, the smoke was rather thick, moderately harsh, and rather expansive — in short, you\\'ll probably cough on this one from one or the other.\\n\\nAbout 5 minutes following the start of the review session, the typically Sativa onset of a buzzing body and changes in head/eye/face pressure set the tone for the majority of the experience. Our heads felt light and floaty, even a little disoriented or dizzy at times, while our bodies were lightly energized, buzzing strongly in the upper legs, forearms, and ears. A familiar Haze-influenced \"sensory blanket\" seemed to have us a little bit duller and slower than normal in a variety of mental processes, though the mood elevation it provided made us not particularly care. As it moved on, our bodies became more relaxed and it moved into the standard Sativa comedown, where the couch is more attractive than movement… this state seemed to go away and come back several times over the final 1.5 hours.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            An attempt to create a total \"throwback\" to the Thai varieties of the 1970\\'s, a landrace Cambodian variety was stabilized by being bred with a Thai-Haze male.\\xa0 The long-flowering and spindly Phnom Penh isn\\'t for the amateur grower, but will reward the persistent with an amazingly racy and cerebral experience, delivered via spicy sandwalwood and incense-flavored foxtailed nugs.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Cambodian landrace x (Thai x Haze)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Spicy and carrying notes of tea \\n\\r\\n            Sandalwood and incense \\n\\r\\n            Very uplifting and cerebral, this hybrid may get on top of some inexperienced users.\\xa0 Not for those suffering from anxiety, Southeast Asian hybrids such as this are known for being near-psychedelic with their effects packages. \\n\\r\\n            Will more than triple in height when in flowering, may require support because it can be so spindly and tall.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Southeast Asia, bred in Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Reeferman Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Around 14 weeks\\r\\n        \\nNepali OG x Snow Lotus. \\n\\r\\n            Nepali OG x Snow Lotus\\r\\n        \\nPine Soul was the name given to a specially selected phenotype of Bodhi Seeds\\' Goji OG.

The appearance was very good as well, with lots of colors and great structure. Though the cannabinoid numbers came back kind of low, the initial potency actually felt rather strong and this strain held steady at medicinal levels for a solid 1.5 - 2 hours, which is very good. It might get on top of you a bit when it shifts gears mid-way through and gets heavy on the eyes, but the worst thing that would happen is an unexpected nap. We recommend this as a very good after-work relaxation med or one that leads into sleep; it was a quality Indica-dominant hybrid experience overall.\\n\\nPezz x Sour Pink Grapefruit\\n\\nA rare clone only, the parents are a Pezz clone held by Apothecary Genetics in California and a Sour Pink Grapefruit male from Hortilab seeds\\n\\nClaw-shaped rain forest green open calyxes with maroon pistils, and long, thin stalked trichomes with medium heads\\n\\nThis was the only area where the name really seemed to fit the strain — the smell it produced reminded us of a sweet pink grapefruit. There were notes of citrus, pine, cherry candy, and flowers, and it was nicely pungent once ground up.\\n\\nWhile it wasn\\'t a bad taste, we really struggled to get much of a read on this one. We got some sweet notes, some slightly spicy/floral notes, and that was about it. The smoke was smooth and enjoyable though, very easy to consume with it non-expansive nature and soft attack.\\n\\nThe Pink Pez started out with a Sativa-feeling head attack, making our foreheads feel heavy and overbearing, as if we had a Neanderthal brow. The initial attack made it a bit hard to focus and there was a clear heart-racing that came on about 10 minutes into it, building in effect until its peak around 30 minutes. Though it was fairly social in nature, we think it would be a bit of a struggle to have a complex conversation with a stranger, etc. — best for easy-going company. A heavy body presence came over us after the initial effects receded — we felt relaxed and drawn to the couch… this stage could easily lead into sleep. Depending on the time of medication, you\\'ll either shake yourself off and continue on with your day once this med brings you back to normal. or you\\'ll be tired enough to just call it an early night.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid,\\r\\n        \\n58-65 Days\\n\\r\\n            An oddly sweet Diesel with a skunky aroma, this unknown strain is thought-provoking and creative.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Unknown lineage, seems to contain Sour Diesel\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Skunky and acrid, it brings to mind Sour Diesel, but might be even more pungent \\n\\r\\n            Strangely sweet and fruity for a Diesel, it also had some citrus and soil elements to it \\n\\r\\n            Creative and motivating, this strain provides a solidly potent package of Sativa effects that last long and leave the user aware and positive.\\xa0 Appetite stimulation, mood elevation, energy, and mild pain relief were the main attributes of this strain. \\n\\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            SoCal Master Kush x Afghani (unconfirmed)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Musky and coffee-like pre-grind, it brightens up a bit and takes on some more standard citrus Kush notes when handled \\n\\r\\n            Floral Kush with hints of menthol and spice \\n\\r\\n            The first 45 minutes or so are Sativa in nature, with an increased heart rate, a buzzing and energetic body presence, and lots of eye and head pressure.\\xa0 After that initial Sativa blast, it turns almost completely Indica, causing heavy relaxation and a lazy, goofy, near-euphoric state.\\xa0 As it dwindles away, the energy level goes down, making this a good lead-in to sleep as well as a general relaxant and mood elevator. \\n\\r\\n            California, USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Perhaps an AFghani-dominant phenotype of F-13, Plum Kush has a heavier effect than normal, more in line with the Blueberry side of the family, but with the spicy Kush-like taste of Flo.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Thought to be a special phenotype of DJ Short\\'s F-13, which is DJ Short\\'s Flo x DJ Short\\'s Blueberry\\r\\n        \\r\\n            When the strain wasn\\'t selling as \"F-13? in a dispensary in Denver, CO, the shop opted to call it \"Plum Kush\" — it sold like crazy and became quite popular while it was still available.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Spicy and slightly sweet, it definitely has elements of both parents \\n\\r\\n            More along the spicy and incense-heavy Kush lines than sweet, tastes much like Flo \\n\\r\\n            Very relaxing and potent, it can affect motor skills a bit and cause couchlock by necessity rather than choice.\\xa0 Heady as well as body-heavy, it\\'s a balanced experience that thoroughly relaxed and improves mood.\\xa0 Its creeper effects can sneak up on you if you overdo the dosage.\\xa0 Strong relaxation, anti-anxiety, pain relief, and sleep aid at higher doses are the main benefits of this strain. \\n\\r\\n            Unknown, likely isolated in the USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            F-13 is 7-9 weeks depending on phenotype, so we\\'d assume 7-8 for this more Indica-leaning pheno\\r\\n        \\nLA Kush x Tang Tang\\n\\nThe Pootie Tang strain was created in 2012 by New House Seed Co. – a joint venture between Tierra Rojo and Paco, two Colorado based growers. The strain is a cross between LA Kush, an indica dominant hybrid known for its relaxing and euphoric properties, and Tang Tang, a racy sativa strain derived from a Blue Sonja backcross. The strain is prevalent in Colorado but can be difficult to find in other states. Pootie Tang won 3rd place at the 2015 Denver Cannabis Cup for best sativa flower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Pootie Tang can take on an appearance that leans towards either one of the parents; however, the Tang Tang influence seems to be more pronounced. The Tang Tang parent brings sativa plant structure with elongated node structure, intense trichome coverage, and large fox-tailing colas. The clone-only LA Kush parent contributes bud density and a slightly darker green bud color. The sample we tested resembled the Tang Tang as opposed to the OG structure one might expect from the LA Kush influence.\\n\\nThe variations in phenotype will also result in variations in smell. However, Pootie Tang can generally be described as earthy, hashy, and tangy. The smell is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with the aroma of each of the parents. The underlying tangy-ness is a mild citrus smell – like a fresh grapefruit as opposed to a ripe orange.\\n\\nOnce again, flavor will vary between phenotypes; however, the taste can generally be described as dry, musty and slightly refreshing. The taste is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with both parents. The refreshing flavors can range from tangy (from the Tang Tang) to more piney (from the LA Kush). Despite the name, do not expect the flavor to be intensely ‘orange.\\'\\n\\nThe powerful sativa qualities of the Tang Tang seem to make their way into nearly every Pootie Tang phenotype. Pootie Tang induces a strong head high with the classic frontal lobe sativa buzz. This strain can be somewhat of a ‘creeper’ with delayed effects that continue to increase in intensity over time. The LA Kush balances out the racy nature of the Tang Tang high. Overall, Pootie Tang induces a classic stoney sativa sensation that is concentrated in the head.\\n\\nBred in Colorado\\nNew House Seed Co.

Pure Kush x Appalachia\\n\\nPura Vida is a serious THC heavyweight. Some test results of cured and dried Pura Vida flower have yielded 26% THCa by weight. Thus, it is renowned by cannabis extract enthusiasts for its high concentrate yield. Beyond cannabinoids, Pura Vida has pungent Afghan Kush terpene profile, full of beta and alpha pinene. Held in high regard by severe pain medical cannabis patients, many describe that heavy terpenes and THC in Pura Vida deliver an analgesic, numbing feeling when consumed. The Appalachia is apparent with chemy skunkiness while the Pure Kush lineage delivers even more aroma and powerful cannabinoids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dense coating of Trichomes is apparent on finished buds. Drying with consistency, each flower looks as though it was neatly manicured, though the dried flowers don’t need much trimming at all. Pura Vida produces medium sized colas that spiral up branches while growing which makes it perfect for hang-drying and slow curing.\\n\\nPura Vida has a nearly offensive-strength terpenes and produces heavy pine, skunk and lemon aromas. Fresh flowers have a more chemy sting to the nose and as the flower dries the skunk and lemon become more dominant.\\n\\nPura Vida produces a thick and rich smoke. Whichever way you prefer to consume cannabis, Pura Vida delivers. Because of its high yield, this flower is prevalent in many concentrates to boost cannabinoids while not compromising any flavor or aroma. A tightly rolled joint may deliver flavor nuances of citrus fruit, pine forest and hopps.\\n\\nBodhi Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Pink Champagne x Grand Daddy Purple\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Purple Champagne is a combination of Pink Champagne and Grand Daddy Purple. Although it is described as a hybrid, some users (and growers) describe it as sativa dominant, as the Grand Daddy Purple used in the breeding of the Purple Champagne is a rare sativa dominant phenotype. Also called Phantom, Pink Champagne is a highly medicinal indica hybrid, and thought to have originated from Cherry Pie and perhaps Grand Daddy Purple.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clustered yet firm and dense buds are typical of Purple Champagne phenotypes, ranging in color from light pink to forest green. The flowers are not consistently purple, like many GDP strains, like Grape Ape, yet the nugs carry marbled purple hues throughout.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            True to the name of Champagne, the buds smell a bit acidic yet fruity like wine. The finished buds carry a hoppy mustiness as well. Some phenotypes exhibit more pine and juniper than others which are more fruity.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Purple Champagne has a heavy smoke that saturates the mouth in a tingly, heated smoke. Some users may prefer to try Purple Champagne in concentrate form. In cannabis extracts, the linalool and myrcene terpene content dominates and may provide a stress-reducing yet uplifting high.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            California\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nGranddaddy Purple x Cotton Candy\\n\\r\\n            Indica dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nPurple Dragon is a very interesting purple strain, as it lacks many of the trademarks aside from the color and taste. Instead of an almost narcotic or \"druggy\" feeling that some purples create, this one was nicely clear and motivated while still carrying the medicinal qualities that cause many patients to seek out purple strains. Purple Dragon is a superb choice for those patients who desire pain and tension relief while not feeling (or looking) drugged up or lazy as is often the case with purple strains.\\n\\nUnknown\\n\\nNorthern California clone scene cut that is possibly a \"selfed\" Purple Urkle with Sativa traits, or Blue Dragon x Urkle\\n\\nA very pretty purple strain that looked nicer than some others we\\'ve seen, with a typical purple in its color palette.\\xa0 It was basically perfect texture-wise and was above-average in trichome coverage \\n\\nA very stinky and musky example of a Purple strain… the pungent musk carries notes of \"dark\" fruits like plums and grapes, which really came out after the grind.\\xa0 In the jar it\\'s got a nice skunkiness to it as well that adds to the pungency… an impressive bouquet overall, though a little on the \"impressive but not exactly pleasurable\" side due to the strong musk factor\\n\\nAn almost cotton candy/bubble gum purple sweetness \\n\\nDefinitely strong in Sativa qualities for a purple strain, this one was almost buzzy and energetic throughout the body and behind the eyes.\\xa0 That subsided fairly quickly though and turned into more of a passive pain relief quality, where one reviewer with back issues was able to work in the garden for nearly 2 hours with no pain to speak of, even after having spasms that morning.\\xa0 Though it provided quality relief, it didn\\'t possess much of an actual body feeling (i.e. buzzing, pulsing, warmth), which was a little unique.\\xa0 It also seemed to have almost no effect on cognition… totally clear-headed and aware, which again is unusual for a purple strain. \\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nEverything you want in a classic Blue Dream with the added bonus of a deep purple hue that gives a gentle indica finish to a well-balanced sativa experience. Overall, Purple Dream appears like any other thin leaved equatorial cannabis varietal until mid to late flower when it starts taking on beautiful purple pastel hues and gains its signature fake grape candy scent.\\n\\nPurple #1 x Blue Dream\\n\\nThe dried flowers are very light purple, almost a water color version of lavendar. \\xa0the contrast to orange pistils is stark and the overall bud structure is mid to whispy, while the size is medium to large.\\n\\nThe aroma is one of a kind, with very sweet notes mixed with synthetic purple candies. \\xa0The hazey nature comes through with a bit of sharp spice reminding you this really does carry the Blue Dream family line very well.\\n\\nSpicy haze is the dominant flavor, though if smoked through fresh glass plenty of the aromatic fruitfulness will strike the back of the tongue.\\n\\nNot as heady as a classic Blue Dream, the Purple #1 evident in its genetics lends users a relaxed, less motivating high while still delivering

of Oakland, CA and may be Purple Afghani x Hindu Kush.\\xa0 The Garberville Purple Kush is most notably held by Swerve of Cali Connection Seeds fame and tends to grow with some foxtails and has more of a straight-up Kush taste/smell with hints of the \"purple\".\\xa0 Kyle Kushman\\'s Las Vegas Purple Kush was claimed in a New Yorker article to be a special Purple Indica x Northern Lights find, but many have since claimed it\\'s an S1 Bubba Kush of some kind due to the dark flavors present.\\xa0 And finally, many old-school people claim that none of the famous clone-only PK\\'s around are in fact the original Purple Kush, which is said to be a very special Purple Pakistani variety that was found in the late 70\\'s or early 80\\'s.\\xa0 As you can see, the history of a strain that\\'s been

catalog).\\n\\nPungent, with notes of \"purple\" (incense, perfume, musky grapes), and the spicy Kush end of the spectrum as well.\\xa0 The SR-71 and Garberville cuts are more \"purple\" in both flavor and smell compared to the Kyle Kushman/Las Vegas Purple Kush. \\n\\nMuch like the smell, the flavor is a dark fruity musk with a bit of sweetness at times — a great blend of the typical purple flavor and traditional Afghani/Pakistani Kush varieties. \\n\\nEminently relaxing and rather potent, Purple Kush is definitely in touch with its Afghani-Pakistani roots.\\xa0 Coming on with a slight rush of energy, that subsides quickly and leaves the user with a floaty, highly medicated body experience that makes aches and pains as well as anxiety/stress melt away.\\xa0 Purple Kush is also known for being a long-laster, normally going out to the 3 hour mark.\\xa0 Recommended highly for body pain, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and sleep aid at higher dosages. \\n\\nGrows well in soil or hydro — they all have fairly strong yield considering the possible Urkle lineage and traditionally slow vegetative growth of purple strains.\\xa0 Cooler temperatures at night and a longer flowering time will help to bring out the purple coloration to a higher degree.\\n\\nAfghanistan/Pakistan mountains, bred and popularized in California, USA\\n\\nClone-only, the most famous and sought-after version is Kyle Kushman\\'s Las Vegas Purple Kush, but there are also the \"Garberville Purple Kush\"\\xa0 and the \"SR71 Purple Kush\", all of which are different but

The body high was extremely evident from the beginning and stayed fairly constant, but the lingering eyes feeling and a slight burst of energy returning to a sober state were the epilogue of this strain\\'s effects.

Collins, Colorado) perhaps being the most sought-after for its incredible Sativa effect and punchy, spice-heavy aroma.\\n\\nThe plant itself tends to grow with pointed colas which bulk up considerably by finish, with some getting into the \"soda can\" realm. \\xa0The long pistils and large calyxes \\xa0make this one fairly easy to trim and also makes for a smooth, easy smoke thanks to the lack of leaves. \\xa0Lime green with creamy orange pistils, the trichomes tend to be shorter with large, bulbous heads and medium-thick coverage overall.\\n\\nA spicy Haze scent with notes of sandalwood, bay leaves, garlic, and a light Dutch Haze type of sweetness at times, which comes through heavily in certain phenotypes.\\n\\nThough the quicker-finishing Afghan-heavy phenotypes are at times sweet, the flavor of the most prized cuts is similar to its namesake, with a bouquet of spice-like flavors with a fresh nature — this one tastes like a true Sativa, reedy and clean on the palate with an expansive but smooth smoke.\\n\\nA true hybrid, it starts out strongly Sativa, with an increase in eye/face pressure, an uptick in heart rate, and racing, at-times disjointed thoughts. \\xa0While not incapacitating mentally, it does slow things down simply because the mind is being pulled in many different directions, following flights of fancy and craving interaction. \\xa0Good for creative pursuits but not as much for settled, detail-oriented work, this one is most conducive to spending a day having fun outside or an evening being productive at home. \\xa0The body effects also tend to start off rather early, warming the limbs and core and relaxing the muscles so that they feel loose and floppy. \\xa0This is a great daytime strain, giving a boost of energy and also relieving body tension and mental stress, a mostly-functional strain perfect for those who stop just short of the raciest, most cerebral varietals.\\n\\nResponds well to training, more than doubles its height in flowering. \\xa0Produces well and will continue throwing out white pistils if fed any type of nitrogen in flowering — this is acceptable though, as the extra bulk overall is worth the additional time.\\n\\nCalifornia, USA, then to Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\n\\nT.H.Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n70-80 days\\n\\r\\n            The East Coast Sour Diesel clone

\\r\\n            The Sour Diesel dominates (as it does in many crosses) and combined with the S.A.G.E. to produce a pungent fuel-pine aroma with a hint of citrus.\\xa0 It seems to get fresher and cleaner when ground up, losing some of the fuel stank. \\n\\r\\n            Diesel-dominant, with a smoky element and a backing vegetal sweetness. \\n\\r\\n            A strong starter, it hits the

    A wonderful example of hybrid vigor, this strain brings together two strains on nearly opposite ends of the spectrum in the 70+ day flowering Sativa-dominant Sour Diesel and the burly, hashy, trich-covered Indica Deep Chunk. \\xa0The flavor and scent expression of the parents changes slightly depending upon medium, phenotype, and growing conditions. \\xa0It normally finishes a deep purple color, with both leaves and calyxes darkening as it approaches harvest time.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            East Coast Sour Diesel x Tom Hill\\'s Deep Chunk\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Bred by Tierra Rojo, this strain has made a home in the Colorado medical marijuana scene, but a special phenotype also still appears in its home state of Texas as the \"Texas Hog Plum\".\\r\\n        \\r\\n            As it\\'s growing, the plants have a deep green and purple coloration that stays intact through harvest and drying/curing. \\xa0Most plants have large hooked calyxes that \"crown\" as the plant reaches maturity, with very fat trichome heads which make fabulous water hash. \\xa0It has a moderate amount of leaf coverage, but the main colas are thick and have a better calyx-to-leaf ratio than the lower branches.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            The ECSD comes through most clearly in the scent, which has strong notes of rubber, fuel, skunks. \\xa0However, there is a creamy, hashy Deep Chunk sweetness that manages to make its way to the forefront now and then. \\xa0The astringent aromas dominate post-grind and this is a strain that is easily-noticed from several feet away when disturbed.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            When properly-grown, a deep flavor which nearly matches the pungency of the aroma lingers on the palate after smoking. \\xa0The flavor is slightly hashier than the aroma, but still has clear skunk, rubber, and fuel elements, especially on the attack. \\xa0The smoke tends to be fairly thick and can cause coughing, but if well-trimmed and cured, it can be very smooth for such a potent smoke.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            A buzzing throughout the face and head comes on with an immediacy that definitely brings to mind the Diesel side of the family. \\xa0It also tends to hit the eyes quite a bit, at times making them burn with effect and continually fluctuating pressure. \\xa0The early part of the duration feels rather Sativa in nature (though on the \"stoney\" and narcotic side of that spectrum) and improves mood while also providing such strong initial potency that it would be difficult to fall asleep. \\xa0However, that changes rather quickly (normally around the 1 hour mark) and the Deep Chunk seems to take hold, filling the body with a buzzing relaxation and bringing the mental pace down quite a few notches. \\xa0This strain is most suitable for an evening burst of cerebral activity leading into relaxation and eventually sleep. \\xa0It\\'s also useful as an all-day medication for users who can continually consume smaller amounts and remain in the Sativa parts of the effect.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            While it performs just fine in hydro, these plants tend to really respond to a robust soil or soilless mix, something that will keep them deep green and healthy until it\\'s time to flush. \\xa0It forms fairly strong central colas but also has a good amount of leaf, making pruning and a judicious trim necessary. \\xa0It handles training well and works for SCROG much better than it does in a single cola SOG style setup — medium sized plants (around 3\\') tend to taste and smell best.\\r\\n

Passion\\'s early crosses primarily meant for outdoor growing in the northern latitudes of The Netherlands, Shaman is known for most of its specimens turning a deep purple. \\xa0The plant isn\\'t a big yielder, and it also isn\\'t the most potent variety, but its pleasant uplifting Sativa effect and complex floral-pine-incense aroma make it a great daytime choice for beginner and intermediate users.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Purple #1 x Early Skunk\\r\\n        \\r\\n            During the 1980\\'s \"Skunk Boom\" in Amsterdam, one of the crosses that came out of the frenzy of Skunk #1-based breeding projects was a strain first called \"Purple Skunk\". \\xa0In 1997, the variety was renamed to \"Shaman\" by Dutch Passion. \\xa0The strain was originally bred to finish outdoors \\xa0in the short Dutch growing season, and manages to do that despite its Sativa phenotypical selection.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Dutch Passion claims that approximately half of the Shaman plants in any seed pack will be green rather than purple, but we\\'ve never seen one that finishes green. \\xa0The buds are a deep purple, almost looking black at times, though the foliage does mostly stay green to finish. \\xa0The small buds appear tucked into the green leaves, but once pruned, the large calyxes and deep orange pistils make this a very attractive strain. \\xa0We\\'ve seen the same \"cut\" of Shaman several times, and it has continually produced purple-headed trichomes (see pictures above, in both dry buds and live plant form), which is an extremely rare trait.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Though it possesses a light \"purple\" scent, with notes of incense and a backing Skunky quality, Shaman has a tangy and fresh aroma once broken apart. \\xa0Hints of citrus, pine, and the smooth floral purple aroma from the pre-grind smell blend into a surprisingly appealing whole.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Much like the smell, it\\'s not the most pungent thing around, but it is complex enough to keep a veteran user\\'s interest. \\xa0A light skunky and floral flavor brings to mind the Skunk more than the Purple side of the family, and the light citrus elements come through as well in the aftertaste. \\xa0Beyond the first hit or two, it\\'s mostly an earthy experience, but the smoke is smooth and light when properly grown and flushed.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            The Sativa billing from the seed company is not a false one — this strain is very uplifting yet smooth and calming (no signs of anxiety), making it a perfect moderately potent daytime choice when an incapacitating mental effect is not desired. \\xa0Social, energetic, and near-euphoric at times, Shaman lasts at a medicinal level for about 1.5 hours, then fades out quickly at about 2.5, leaving behind no side effects.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Shaman is never really a big-yielding variety, but it does seem to prefer being grown in hydro when being cultivated indoors, bulking up a bit more than when grown in soil mixes. \\xa0However, the flavor and aroma seem to take on a more pleasing sweetness in soil, so it\\'s mostly a question of what the grower is striving for.\\r\\n

However, this strain showed us that old Dutch seedbank material has its good points, as it provided a great Sativa-hybrid experience and a huge dose of fresh, sweet, fruity notes in both the flavor and the aroma. This particular grow was mostly without flaw, and we especially liked seeing the array of cloudy trichomes, which seems increasingly rare (we often see a bunch of clear heads with patches of ambers mixed in rather than a true progression). While its strong start and at times racy effect may get on top of some inexperienced patients, it was moderately potent overall and would be suitable for daytime relief for mid-to-experienced patients. This is a strong first KindReview for Green Mountain CARE, and we look forward to seeing more choices from their garden.\\n\\r\\n            Early Pearl x Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5\\r\\n        \\nBred by Sensi Seeds to create an easy-to-grow stress-resistant varietal for indoor cultivation\\n\\nClaw-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight closed cluster calyxes, with bursts of burnt umbre pistils, and average coverage with thick-stalked wavy trichomes with large heads\\n\\nWe were almost taken aback at how nice this sample smelled, both in the jar/bag and once it was broken up or ground. It reminded us of some of the better Jack Herer/Jack Flash samples we\\'ve had, except with more of the candy sweetness you find in something like Island Sweet Skunk or Cotton CandyRomulan. Sweet, fruity, and floral, it has elements of rose petals, grape candy, and fresh citrus cleaner — these aromas seem to blend and appear at different times, making for a complex and enjoyable experience. While not outwardly pungent like something in the Diesel/Kush family, it was a strong and bold aroma nonetheless.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s worth noting that one reviewer didn\\'t seem to care much for the flavor and noted some harshness when burning, the rest of the staff had no such complaints. We got a very fresh, lightly sweet and fruity flavor that seemed to match the pre-grind smell for the most part. It had notes of eucalyptus, citrus, and flowers on the initial hits but burned away into more of a lightly spicy (yet still sweet) flavor that brought to mind cinnamon. The smoke was extremely smooth for the majority of the staff (one using a glass pipe, one using an IncrediBowl) and coughing was minimal. The final ash finished with some dark areas, indicating that a longer or more thorough flush would have been beneficial… that didn\\'t affect the flavor much in our estimation, however.\\n\\nThe effects of this strain were noticed almost immediately after exhaling, with the usual package of Sativa pressure effects rising up into our heads. A fluttery, light feeling in the torso area and an major uptick in both mood and mental activity also added to the Sativa start we experienced. It bordered on anxious at times, but its background body relaxation seemed to help keep us calm and in a positive, borderline euphoric mood. While it was difficult to concentrate on one thing, it seemed to aid with overall mental activity, making some of the staff feel like multi-tasking machines, jumping capably from task to task but never lingering. The fairly excitable state declined in potency after about an hour, then shifted gears at about 1.5 hours to a more relaxing state that lost the at-times anxious edge. The effect\\'s endurance was also somewhat surprising, lasting at a medicinal level for 2 solid hours, then declining quickly from there but lingering in the eyes for a full 3 hours.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWe really enjoyed the effects of this strain, which served to really energize us through the peak of the effects without ever feeling anxious or overwhelming. SK9 seemed to go with the flow of the day, making us feel comfortable and capable at nearly any project we took on. The second half came with some drowsiness, but a quick re-medication would fix that. The crisp Haze-influenced aroma and taste were both pleasing, if a bit indistinct, and we had no real complaint about the appearance. We like this strain as a daytime motivator, or perhaps as an after-work \"up-then-down\" type of med, where you can get things done and then ease into a relaxing night.\\n\\r\\n            Skunk Haze x Early Girl\\r\\n        \\nSpade-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stack calyxes, with bursts of ocher pistils, and above-average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large heads\\n\\nSweet and spicy, this strain\\'s Skunk lineage was evident from the start. Though it wasn\\'t an overtly pungent strain, it definitely made its presence known, especially when broken apart. This reminded us of some old school strains for sure, with a fresh quality that brought to mind some of the Haze Skunk hybrids such as Jack Herer.\\n\\n Crisp and fresh, it had a taste that almost reminded us of sweet peppers, with some spicy qualities and a hint of sweetness. The smoke was super-smooth and caused almost no coughing, hitting the throat softly and not expanding much at all. \\n\\nAfter finishing the review samples, we became immediately alert-feeling, energized, and motivated to complete various household tasks. While it did lower the eyelids and redden the eyes a bit, there were no other noticeable signs of being medicated, as we felt completely capable in complex conversations and tasks. While this one wasn\\'t a total pain reliever, there was some element of relief, mainly in the neck and shoulder areas. As it progressed beyond 1.5 hours, it definitely became more sedate and relaxing, even bordering on tiring. This is a common occurance with very \"uppy\" strains, as going back to normal often seems like a dip, when it\\'s really just returning to the median.\\n\\r\\n            California\\r\\n        \\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            The first true commercial hybrid ever stabilized, it came from California by way of Sam the Skunkman following his release from prison in 1982.\\xa0 Skunk #1 is a disease and pest-resistant strain that has been bred into countless strains and forms the backbone of much of the Dutch commercial market.\\xa0 The plant itself is a good producer, exhibiting much hybrid vigor and a high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making trimming a breeze.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Acapulco/Mexican Gold x (Colombian Gold x Afghani)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            There is a massive story about Skunk #1 from Outkast Seeds, which can be found at the following link:\\xa0http://www.rollitup.org/seed-strain-reviews/48884-skunk-1-story.html.\\xa0 It details the early breeding history and lineage of Skunk #1, the difficulty in stabilization of the Colombian Gold x Afghani side of the equation, the bust of Sacred Seeds and the recovery of seed stock and importation to Holland which followed.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of Skunk varieties do not smell skunky, but rather a pungently sweet and slightly fruity smell.\\xa0 The Dutch and BC Skunks are especially sweet, often carrying an element of creamy citrus.\\xa0 The original Skunk #1 that was favored by the American breeders was thought to possess more of the real skunk smell. \\n\\r\\n            Lightly sweet with a thick, strong smoke, Skunk #1 isn\\'t really known for its taste, but its mix of sweet and hashy flavors is a callback to the early origins of commercial marijuana. \\n\\r\\n            Relaxing yet mentally uplifting, Skunk #1 will elevate mood while keeping the user mostly close to the couch.\\xa0 It provides good pain relief and muscle relaxation qualities while making the user a little bit slow mentally.\\xa0 This is the standard \"high\" feeling mixed with some of the sedative elements thanks to the Afghani. \\n\\r\\n            Grows well in soil or hydro but the best taste is achieved through organic soil means.\\xa0 It grows stout and has an Indica-dominant structure, with dense buds, while the Sativa elements contribute a high calyx-to-leaf ratio and hybrid vigor.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            California, USA, later brought to Amsterdam, The Netherlands by Sam the Skunkman\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Originally offered by the long-defunct Sacred Seeds in 1979, it has since been bred into thousands of hybrids and put out in seed form by almost every Dutch seedbank.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            55-60 days\\r\\n        \\nWith plenty of hybrid vigor and great commercial potential, this cross of two classics is recommended for commercial growers due to its yield and its easy manicuring.\\n\\nSkunk #1 x Northern Lights #5\\n\\nNormally Skunk-dominant, with a fruity and pungent aroma, it also has hints of the more earthy and piney Northern Lights #5. \\n\\nFairly neutral blend of slight sweetness, pine, and earthy flavors. \\n\\nSedative and feeling rather Indica-dominant, this strain is good for relaxation, sleep aid, and minor pain relief.\\xa0 The Sativa components of the Skunk seem to have been mostly bred out for commercial purposes… this feels like almost a straight-up Indica with its relaxing and near-tiring effect. \\n\\nGrows well in either soil or hydro, good for SOG applications if un-topped, can easily be trained into whatever shape is desired.\\n\\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\\n\\nThe Seed Bank of Holland\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            [INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION AVAIL]\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid, mix of Acapulco Gold, Columbian Gold, and an Afghani\\r\\n        \\nWhile the overall potency and somewhat steep fall-off around 1.5 hours left us wishing for slightly more potency overall, it seems that part of that was due to the overall clarity of the experience — it never felt overbearing or pushy.

The hybrid produces larger nugs than the Ape and demonstrates the hybrid vigor one would expect from such a cross. The mottled purple coloration and tangy sour grape-meets flowers aroma is immediately enticing to users, while the flavor and potent effects keep them coming back for more.\\nSour Grape has shown promise in relief of digestive problems, nausea, anxiety, and moderate muscle tension. It also stimulates the appetite quite a bit while improving mood in an even-handed manner, making it suitable for patients seeking versatile relief for either day or night.\\n\\nGrape Ape x Sour Diesel\\n\\nBred by Apothecary Genetics from their Grape Ape mother, this strain is often confused with \"Sour Grapes\", an alternate name for Gage Green Genetics\\' \"Grape Stomper\", an entirely different cross. \\xa0This confusion has not stopped either strain from gaining major popularity in both the California and Colorado medical markets.\\n\\nLike its parent strain Grape Ape, Sour Grapes tends to be a mottled purple rather than turning entirely purple, with a collection of soft almost pastel-like colors blending into a harmonious whole. \\xa0The nugs are of medium density thanks to a bit of Sativa influence added from the Diesel, but they still mostly retain the Grape Ape shape and overall structure. \\xa0Trichome coverage is above average but there is still enough room to let the color shine through (it doesn\\'t look white to the naked eye).\\n\\nAn engaging mix of the two parent strains, Sour Grapes has a fairly soft grape sweetness in the bag but blows up into a complex sour fruit aroma with hints of flowers and incense lingering in the background. \\xa0It doesn\\'t tend to have outward Diesel elements, but the added sharpness can definitely be detected among the Grape-dominant package of smells.\\n\\nSweet and sour grape dominates the flavor, and the Diesel takes a definite backseat, never really being picked up except in that the taste is unlike the standard Grape Ape. \\xa0It has an expansive, thick smoke which can often cause coughing.\\n\\nAs would be expected with the parental lineage, the effects feel almost like a 50/50 hybrid of Indica and Sativa, with both seemingly coexisting peacefully rather than pulling the patient one way then another. \\xa0A balanced mix of facial and head effects blend with a buzzing body that tends to be most comfortable when immobile, resulting in a relaxed but mentally-aware state that is suitable and fairly productive for sedentary mental tasks, but not particularly suited to more strenuous activity. \\xa0It hits hard early on and then peters out quite a bit after the hour mark, converting into more of a base relaxation but still retaining mental clarify and not reaching into the heavy, sleepy end of the Indica spectrum.\\n\\nA robust plant, Sour Grape branches well and responds positively to SCROG setups but can also be grown untopped for a fairly large single cola and moderate side growth. \\xa0This plant can take fairly heavy feedings and grows equally well in soil or hydroponic setups.\\n\\nCalifornia, USA\\n\\nApothecary Genetics\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid (leans Indica)\\r\\n

The change was unexpected and refreshing, because Sour Diesel seems to completely take over so many crosses.\\n\\nThe flavor was a bit confusing and not as pungent as the aroma, giving us a sharp attack with just a hint of Diesel, then basically leaving behind a clean, fresh, mentholated feeling in the mouth rather than much of a taste. The smoke was smooth and didn\\'t cause coughing except on the largest hits, while the flush appeared to be nearly perfect, leaving behind only a fluffy white ash. This one was enjoyed by all and was repeatedly described as \"pleasant\", but just didn\\'t wow us with a pungent flavor.\\n\\nThis strain hit us with an almost entirely Sativa package of effects, increasing both the mental and physical energy of our staff, filling us with a buzzing body and head presence. Facial warmth, ocular/temple pressure, some body numbing, and a racing heart continued through most of the initial hour, eventually backing off slightly into a less racy and cerebral state. We found conversation easy when it was around, but it was also easy to get stuck in your own head so to speak, staring off in space while deep in thought, or zoning in on a project and shutting out the outside world. The buzzing body continued throughout most of the experience and served to make this a fairly versatile med in terms of context, making us equally satisfied with activities or relaxation. A smooth decline in effect left us feeling relaxed but still aware, with no real crash to speak of.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            We\\'re unsure where this strain came from despite the lineage being clear.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Trainwreck x Sensi Star\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Slightly sweet and vegetal \\n\\r\\n            Brings to mind holiday spices, something like candied oranges stuffed with cloves.\\xa0 Not a particularly pungent taste, but enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\\r\\n            Indica in nature, this strain was relaxing without being incapacitating.\\xa0 It did have definite couchlock tendencies, but if motivated by external sources, the user is left mentally active and capable.\\xa0 Solid pain relief and muscle/nerve relaxation makes this one a good choice for those suffering from neck and back pain. \\n\\r\\n            USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nChem-4 x Tres Dawg\\n\\nChem 4 was an original seed popped after a Grateful Dead tour 1991 when two guys from Colorado networked with a fellow fan from Masachusetts. One ounce of supreme quality \"Dog Bud\" (the nickname given to the original plant, possibly originating in Oregon) had a handful of seeds. Of those seeds, one was Chem Dog 4. An allstar of it\\'s own, it was bred to Tres Dawg, a Chem Dog exclusive breeding project. By compounding desired traits in the flowers, Stardawg is remarkably dense, pungent and stoney.\\n\\nSprouting from perhaps the most influential strain in the modern cannabis market, Stardawg is the cumulation of two Chem Dawg (Chem Dog) strains, of which also spawned from exclusive Chem Dog breeding projects. The legend of Chem Dog, later named Chem Dawg by Top Dawg Seeds, is grand and since the early 90\\'s the strain has become a common ancestor of most strains enjoyed in the 21st century.\\n\\nStardawg has a dense, velvety texture. Large buds are common in growth and unlike other Chem Dog strains, hold together with minimal stem weight and have an original Skunk #1 appeal.\\n\\nStardawg is alarmingly potent in chemical, acidic and pine fragrances. Like it\\'s counterparts in the Chem Dog family, It truly smells like a dead skunk and has a very pevasive odor.\\n\\nThe musk lingering in the ambient aroma translates directly to flavor, where one may have a salivating or lip smacking reaction when consuming. Thus, it\\'s a favorite for processing into concentrates and the lineage of Chem Dog has spread to most modern day strains.\\n\\nCategorized as a sativa-dominant hybrid, Stardawg has varying effects, mostly relying on personal preference as a guide. For some, Chem Dog strains, and Stardawg in particular, gives a very uplifting, motivational experience most commonly found in sativas. Conversely, some will feel a lethargic ambivalent reaction that is typically enjoyed with indicas. As a result, different shops and seed companies market Chem Dog and Stardawg as indicas or sativas. It\\'s a safe bet to expect a rich THC experience as it typically tests above average compared to other strains.\\n\\n\\nInterested in growing?

Dog Bud is believed to be an unknown strain from Oregon from the 1980\\'s or perhaps even before. From there, Top Dawg Seed Company has proliferated the lineage to extreme popularity. It is rumored that there are still a few original Chem Dog seeds yet to be germinated.\\n\\nA result of successive breeding projects of Chem Dog (or Chem Dawg), Stardawg is an elite clone-only strain that exemplifies the most desired traits from the original from back in the early 90\\'s.\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Unconfirmed lineage, possibly containing Morning Star, the 100% Indica strain from Northern California.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            The smell is almost like rotting fruit, with a slightly putrid and musky element to it.  \\n\\r\\n            Rather neutral and in the earthy/herby category. \\n\\r\\n            Focusing mostly on the head, Starfruit exhibits a swirling and vibrating feeling around the skull which encourages a relaxed mindset.\\xa0 It was a bit of a creeper, increasing in effect and causing a pressure jump in the eyes and a pain-free and relaxed body.\\xa0 It helped with appetite, general relaxation, and pain relief while remaining nicely clear-headed throughout. \\n\\r\\n            USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n

in the taste, and it mimics the smell to a great extent. \\n\\r\\n            Extremely uplifting, the Stevie is a strain that will have a smile creeping across your face almost immediately.\\xa0 It\\'s a very clear-headed strain whose Sativa-dominance is apparent throughout the experience.\\xa0 Along with the mental uplift is a quality body relaxation and pain relief component. \\n\\r\\n

Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Bred and selected for a very potent, Indica-dominant effect, it appears that the mission was accomplished.\\xa0 This strain really packs a punch and can send the user into sleep rather easily — very relaxing and narcotic in nature.\\xa0 The plant itself is stretchier than the Bubba Kush mom but has tighter buds. \\xa0Blue-purple is the dominant color once it gets close to harvest… a very dark-colored and resinous plant.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            (Bubba Kush x DJ Short\\'s Blue Moonshine) backcrossed to the Bubba Kush

strong and musky, reminiscent mostly of the Bubba Kush mother with tinges of hashy sweet fruit\\n\\r\\n            Again, strong and musky, with some of the Bubba Kush dark tastes (coffee, chocolate, garlic) and just a slight sweetness that comes out at times \\n\\r\\n            Overwhelming at times, Stone Mountain is very potent and hits strong with a direct Indica effect almost immediately. \\xa0A deep, pervading sense of relaxation, strong muscle tension relief, and definite sleep aid properties at higher dosages.\\xa0 Recommended for experienced patients who can handle the potency and desire strong Indica-dominant relief — this one has shown great promise in relieving the side effects of chemotherapy and cancer including loss of appetite, pain, nausea, headaches, and muscle tension.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Stretches more than the Bubba Kush mother.\\xa0 A long and thorough flush is recommended to bring out an array of fall colors, which normally get overtaken by purple as the plant finishes.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Bubba Kush is thought to be an Afghani/Pakistani variety, while DJ Short\\'s Blue Moonshine is out of California — this cross was created

\\r\\n            65 days\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Known for its sweet and Hazy smell, this special clone-only strain was discovered by chance and went on to become a High times Strain of the Year in 2005 while also becoming a major piece in breeding projects for its collection of terpenes.\\xa0 The 100% Indica Strawberry Fields mother lends stoutness, weight, and that lovely sweetness to the strain, while the Haze seems to contribute the majority of the effects.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Strawberry Fields x Haze\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Kyle Kushman (the widely-accepted

turned out to be a pretty special and unique plant.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            The sweet berry cream elements dominate, but there is a sharp Haze in the background. \\n\\r\\n            Slightly flowery and almost soapy at times, there is a bit of fruity sweetness, but it changes places from the smell and takes its turn in the background. \\n\\r\\n            Uplifting and cerebral, bordering on trippy at times… the Haze definitely comes through most strongly in the experience.\\xa0 It does carry a solid body relaxation component, but ultimately it\\'s a head-centric strain. \\n\\r\\n            Grows well anywhere, it\\'s a hearty plant thanks to the Indica side of its parentage, branching out and staying relatively short throughout its life cycle.\\xa0 Good for SCROG setups, not

(this is feminized stock, so it was also a female plant) adds robust growth and vigor while reducing overall size.\\xa0 With tight internodal spacing, it is a solid choice for Haze lovers who don\\'t want a gigantic plant that is impossible to keep contained indoors.\\xa0 The structure also tends to be fairly linear, making it a good choice for SOG methods and other vertical growing.\\n\\nSwiss Sativa x (Northern Lights #5 x Haze C), also called \"Arjan\\'s Strawberry Haze\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreated by Arjan, Green House\\'s master breeder during the period of 2000-2004, it was finally released to rave reviews in 2006.\\n\\nSaccharine sweet strawberry + melons + flowers aroma, one of the sweetest-smelling sativas you\\'ll find. \\n\\nSlightly less pronounced than the smell, the flavor is still almost identical to the aroma, with its candy-like fruit flavor lasting through the majority of the dosage. \\n\\nEnergetic without being rushy, this is a social, creative type of sativa that elevates mood and sparks the mind. \\n\\nTastes best in soil but produces best in hydro, like many strains.\\xa0 Grows very well outdoors and finished mid-October in Northern hemispheres, often as a massive 7 ft. bush.\\n\\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\\n\\nGreen House Seed Company, available as feminized seed stock only\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nAbout 75 days\\n\\nSmelling fruity and sweet, the Sour Diesel elements seem to come through more on the smoke, chasing off the berry notes.\\xa0 Several versions exist, but the most common version is a mellow Sativa that gets its smell from the Strawberry Cough and its appearance and flavor primarily from the Sour Diesel/Kush side of the family.\\n\\nStrawberry Cough x Raspberry Kush x Sour Diesel — multiple versions appear to exist, as Strawberry Cough x OG Kush and OG Kush x California Indica (from Royal Dutch Genetics) are also listed in various sources\\n\\nSweet and fruity, very much reminiscent of the strawberry and raspberry genetics — only a hint of sharpness \\n\\nSpicy and Kush-dominant, lacking the fruitiness that was present in the smell. \\n\\nSort of a dual experience, this feels like a true hybrid in that it has a buzzing Sativa body energy but the mental state is supremely relaxed.\\xa0 It seemed to affect the face and eyes rather heavily, making it feel slightly tiring at times despite the body never feeling drowsy.\\xa0 It was a worthy strain for pain distraction but didn\\'t seem to actually relieve it.\\xa0 Appetite stimulation, general relaxation, and ocular attention are the main medical benefits — recommended as an anytime sort of medicine, only at higher doses would it get to the overwhelming area. \\n\\nCalifornia, USA\\n\\nClone only, though Royal Dutch Genetics offers a seed version of Strawberry Kush… it\\'s not the known cross though and is OG Kush x California Indica, making it Indica-dominant.\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid (most common version)\\r\\n        \\nAround 65-70 days for the Sativa-dom version\\n\\nThe smell is something very unique that most of us hadn\\'t encountered previously, a very refreshing and complex aroma that reminded us of other strains but always threw a wrench into the mix with an unexpected whiff of something. The effects were certainly Indica-dominant in the \"stoned\" vein where sitting on the couch relaxing and staring blankly at a movie seems like a great idea, making this a highly recommendable evening medication. It\\'s great for unwinding at the end of the day without being incapacitated and serves to prepare the body and mind for a night of restful sleep.\\n\\r\\n            (Crystal Gayle x Blue Hawaiian) x Sensi Star\\r\\n        \\nIn-house strain bred by Grasshopper Wellness in Colorado\\n\\nClaw shaped fern green calyxes , formed in tight closed clusters, with robin red pistils, and an above average density of average length, thin stalked trichomes with large heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomes\\n\\nThis strain has a very unique aroma that brought to mind a variety of sharp yet sweet scents. A burst of lime-kissed cleaner meets a sugary cherry syrup quality — it\\'s certainly very sweet but the freshness and sharpness adds a complex dimension that was not noticed before breaking/grinding it up. Top-notch aroma here, and very unique.\\n\\nThe initial flavor was much like the smell — a more flowery and smooth version of the lime-pine-sweetness combination. As the taste progressed though, it took on more of a holiday spice + anise quality, with an interesting sharp muskiness. The flavor degraded quite a bit th0ugh as it progressed, making us cough quite a bit and leaving a slightly funky aftertaste. Flush-wise, it could definitely use some work, as the final ash was a somewhat murky dark gray for most of the review staff.\\n\\nThis strain started off with a little mental boost, serving to slap us awake a little bit with its potency. There were a strange package of pressure effects with this one, with multiple reviewers reporting strong jaw, ear, and forehead pressure — the ears were especially unique, as they were both warm and pressurized. Beyond the odd physical sensations with this one, it moved quickly into an Indica state of goofy, slightly lazy relaxation where mental function was intact, but just barely. Definitely a couchy movie-watching type of strain, though even concentrating on something like that might be a little more difficult than normal. Dropping in effect quite a bit after 1.5 hours, it had a smooth comedown that left us feeling relaxed and ready for bed, depending on the timing of medication.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n

#7 x Hashplant\\n\\nLightly sweet but overall fairly earthy/hashy like most Hashplants \\n\\nNondescript flavor with a background of sweetness — normally described as \"hashy\" \\n\\nThe start is rather heady and Sativa in nature, but it quickly shows its true colors as an Indica-dominant hybrid, with strong body relaxation properties and a mildly hazy mental state.\\xa0 Recommended as a late

the mood elevation and ocular effects. This one fits somewhere in the functional daytime Indica category at lower dosages, but creeps into the nighttime Indica category when the dosage is stepped up, and especially without remedication, as the end of the experience was fairly tiring for our staff.\\n\\nFat arrowhead-shaped olive drab sepals, arranged in loose cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of light ochre pistils, and average coverage with long thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average heads\\n\\nThe crisp, clean, fresh-smelling aroma that this strain produced definitely brought to mind both of the parents, as well as other strains such as Colorado Cough, Snowcap, and other NL #5/Haze variants. It almost tingles the nose with a mentholated flowery sweetness, getting quite a bit more pungent when it\\'s broken apart.\\n\\nThe flavor was almost exactly like the aroma, which is normally a good sign in our minds. Clean and smooth, it was a little sweet going in and left behind a flowery, mentholated aftertaste which left the mouth feeling fresh and the lungs breathing easy. The fluffy light gray and white ash left behind was further evidence of the proper flush, dry, and cure that this sample appeared to have received.\\n\\nThe initial effects of this one were Sativa in nature for the majority of our staff, serving to wake up our minds a bit and just provide a little jolt to the system due to the potency. We also got some early facial effects (specifically in the jaw and eye areas, strangely enough) and an immediate mood elevation, which had use feeling functional and content. After the first 30-45 minutes, the experience took a heavy turn for one of our reviewers, where he was almost falling asleep on the couch mid-evening (a rarity), due in large part to the at times heavy eye effects, which made them feel sunken, heavy, and a little dry. The other reviewers didn\\'t get to the point of falling asleep, but it did start feeling heavier in general, providing quite a bit of relaxation, both mentally and physically. For an Indica-dominant hybrid, the end of this one felt suspiciously similar to the \"crash\" that one often feels at the end of a high-octane Sativa experience, leaving us a bit drained and tired, but still mentally positive and happy.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nClone\\n\\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            [Insufficient Data & Images in KR]\\r\\n        \\nSuper Silver Haze x Sour DieselLimited seed release bred by Reservoir Seeds combining oldschool Greenhouse Seeds Super Silver Haze and Reservoir\\'s Sour Diesel IBL\\n\\nEast Coast\\n\\nLimited Seed Release\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nA fusion of some pretty ridiculous genetics, this strain is caked with tall, fat-headed trichomes and produces a hearty fuel-Kush stank when disturbed.\\n\\nSuper Sour Deez (Sour Diesel IBL x Sour Lemon Larry OG Kush) x Fire White OG Kush (OGRaskal\\'s Fire OG Kush x Krome\\'s The White)\\n\\nNot a ton of information available on this particular hybrid, but from Elite Genetics\\' website, it appears that it would be a 9-10 week flowering.\\xa0 As far as the parent strains go, Elite is known for breeding with an IBL (inbred line, meaning highly stabilized) Sour Diesel for many of their projects, including this one.\\xa0 OGRaskal\\'s Fire OG Kush is one of the super-elite Kush clones floating around the world right now, and Krome\\'s \"The White\" cut (aka Triangle) is another of the absolute top-level clones.\\xa0 All the parent strains sport a strong fuel or Kush element to their taste and smell, making this strain a pretty incredible concentration of those flavor and aroma terpenes.\\n\\nA near-overwhelming blend of fuel, gun oil, and chemical stank and the more subtle flowery/spicy notes of the Kush.\\xa0 Skunky from a distance, it yields some fennel and citrus aromas when broken up and allowed to settle a bit.\\xa0 A real \"must smell\" for Kush and Diesel lovers… \\n\\nMuch like the smell, it\\'s a true fusion of the harsh and acrid Sour Diesel flavors and the subtle Kush, which includes spice and citrus.\\xa0 Enduring and never taking a bad turn, the smoke was flavorful, thick and powerful without being a total lung-buster. \\n\\nVery strong off the bat, with a spacey mental state and the urge to just sit and soak in the world, this strain is certainly above-average in potency.\\xa0 A Sativa effects package to start with lots of head/eye pressure fluctuations, changes in visual perception, and a boost of energy.\\xa0 Despite the potency, it leaves you able to focus if needed, generally on one task at a time.\\xa0 It shifts gears around the 2 hour mark, converting into more of a sedating experience with solid body relaxation properties. \\n\\nUSA — Elite Genetics was based out of Michigan, but most of the genetics involved here are from California\\n\\nElite Genetics Seed Company\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nAssume 65+ days… it says 9-10 weeks on Elite\\'s now-defunct website\\n\\nUnexpectedly sweet and fruity, this strain will certainly please those patients who place smell on the top of their list of qualities to look for.

It was a rather smooth smoking experience but left a medium gray ash and likely could\\'ve used a slightly longer flush.\\n\\nTruly a pure Indica/Afghani experience, this strain provided great relaxation properties throughout the body and mind, but especially in the upper back/shoulder/neck area, which felt particularly nice. A creeping head effect (one reviewer mentioned a \"headband feeling\") was mostly concentrated in the eyes and also led to a slightly slow and goofy mental state with an elevated mood.

The plant is one of the most uncanny-smelling fruity strains on the planet, smelling and tasting exactly like a freshly-peeled tangerine, down to the sensation of the semi-bitter skin. It grows tall and vigorously, forming strong creamy-orange colas that perfume the room.\\nOne of the most often overlooked elements of the DHK was the ability of its members to grow out multiple identical packs of seeds, compare the best females in order to find true keepers. The DHK Tangerine Haze is one such example. Members picked up the original G13/Haze x NYCD from Soma Seeds in 03-04 and over the next year each grew out his pack of seeds, compared the best females, and it was obvious which female stood out (at least in flavor). Nicknamed Tangerine Haze, this strain is still fairly hoarded even though it has been passed freely for the last couple of years. The strain made its way from the West Coast of Canada to Boulder and Nederland, Colorado, where it became something of a legend among the growers and connoisseurs of the area.\\n\\nOriginal Soma Seeds New York City Diesel x G-13/Haze\\n\\nThe smell of Tangerine Haze is legendary as being one of the few fruit-named strains that is a perfect replica of its namesake, filling the sinuses with a pungent and uncanny tangerine smell with a floral backdrop. \\xa0If it\\'s let go beyond 65 days, it often takes on an astringent quality, so most growers like to take her down early if anything.\\n\\nThe flavor is almost more tangerine-heavy than the scent, even going as far as to give the flavor of the semi-bitter skin or citrus zest along with the fresh citrus attack. \\xa0The flavor tends to linger in the mouth and sinuses for a long time after consumption, which increases the already amazing taste appeal of this strain.\\n\\nTangerine Haze isn\\'t the strongest strain around, but it lives up to its Haze name, uplifting the user\\'s mindstate and filling the body and mind with a buzzing energy. \\xa0Great for creative pursuits, outdoor activities, and anything that can be enhanced with a slight shift of perspective - Tangerine Haze is a wonderful daytime strain that leaves the user feeling capable and at-ease mentally.\\n\\nTangerine Haze grows tall and works best when it\\'s flowered early on from clone, when the plant is approximately 10\" and has just established itself.\\n\\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands, bred and selected in North America by the \"Devil\\'s Harvest Krew\"\\n\\nElite clone-only variety\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\n65 days, it tends to lose some of the tangerine quality if let go beyond that point\\n\\r\\n            Tangerine Haze (NYCD x G13/Haze) X OG Kush\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nLike many Sativas, this one hit our staff a bit differently depending on the time of day and incoming mood — your experience may vary according to the same. It\\'s definitely a strong Sativa though, which we would probably peg at around 85%… the effects package was almost entirely mental and/or body energy. While the taste was a bit confusing, the rest of the appeal categories were definitely above-average, displaying very traditional Sativa structure and texture that\\'s always nice to see. We recommend this to those patients who are looking for a Sativa to give them a boost of energy but don\\'t mind a possible bit of anxiousness — depending on how it affects you, your mental state should still be active and engaged… whether or not the body follows along is another matter.\\n\\r\\n            ((Heirlom Thai) x (Landrace Ruderalis) x Danish Passion) x Short Term Amnesia\\r\\n        \\nBred by Bald Monkey seeds to be an early-finishing autoflowering Sativa variety \\n\\nNot very pungent in the jar at all, this strain had a sweet-sour and slightly putrid tropical fruit bouquet when ground up, reminding one reviewer of papaya. This was a fairly unique smell, though not pungent enough to be all that impressive.\\n\\nThe majority of reviewers picked up on darker sweet flavors, such as roasted marshmallows, coffee, and nuts… but one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) caught a faint distinct yet disitinct fruit skin taste that danced peach skin that and grapefruit peel as the bowl burned. \\n\\nRushy thoughts immediately crept into our heads as this medication took hold, energized and borderline anxious with mental energy as well as a physical buzzing throughout the body. It could certainly be described as \"heart-racing\" at first — it really felt strongly Sativa from the outset, hitting the eyes and head with lots of pressure fluctuations as well and inducing a cerebral, philosophical, and slightly psychedelic mental state. Our team was a bit split on the rest of the experience, with half of us reporting a fairly functional (yet rushy and a bit spacey) energy and the other half feeling mentally energetic but not feeling like doing much of anything. We all agreed that it left us a bit drained after the fact though, as it returned us to a normal energy level, then dipped below that to the point where we were actually drowsy-feeling.\\n\\nDenmark\\n\\nSeed\\n\\r\\n            Sativa Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n64-71 Days\\n\\r\\n            A relaxing Indica-dominant strain that is hearty and resistant to mold and disease.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Swiss Sativa Skunk x (Super Skunk x Northern Lights)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Grows best in soil\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Green House Seed Company\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            63 days\\r\\n        \\nThe Tang Tang is from Grindhouse Medical Seeds\\' Sonja line (derived from Blockhead but Sativa-dominant) and adds some needed heft, vigor, and yield to the normally stingy Pre-\\'98 Bubba Kush mom. \\xa0The different phenotypes are almost like different strains, with the Bubba-dominant phenos taking on the rounded shape and large calyxes of the mother, and the Tang Tang growing pointed colas with leaves coated from stem to tip with trichomes. \\xa0A skilled selection process will yield incredible results with this one. \\xa0\\n\\nPre-\\'98 Bubba Kush x Tang Tang males\\n\\nThis strain was released in 2010 by Grindhouse Medical Seeds. \\xa0The particular phenotypes shown above were isolated by breeder \"Tierra Rojo\" during that same year, in an effort to find the two ends of the parental spectrum.\\n\\nThe Bubba-dominant plants definitely recall the mother, but have a less foreboding and musky aroma, seemingly being freshened up by the herbal and zesty Tang Tang. \\xa0Both phenos have notes of incense, hash, citrus, and the backing \\xa0deep chocolate/coffee notes of the Bubba, but the Tang Tang just has less aroma overall, smelling mostly of the trichomes that coat every surface.\\n\\nWith a background of the Bubba dankness, the flavor is lightened up by the Tang Tang, adding elements of citrus and herbs. \\xa0The flavor isn\\'t overwhelmingly strong like a proper Bubba is, but it hands in the mouth in much the same way, reminding the user of the flavor seemingly at random for a while after smoking.\\n\\nThe Tang Tang adds a potent package of head effects and seems to step up the overall potency of the Bubba. \\xa0The Tang Tang phenotypes have a very strong head presence, with a feeling of a boulder rolling around inside the back of the skull at times, as well as quite a bit of eye pressure fluctuation. \\xa0It has major mood elevating properties as well, finishing cleanly and without any sort of crash — it makes for a versatile medication suitable for day or night use. \\xa0The Bubba-dominant phenotypes are definitely heavier, and if let go long will pack quite the narcotic punch, aiding sleep and relaxing muscles.\\n\\nGrows well with heavy training such as \"super-cropping\", as the Tang Tang line adds more flexibility and strength to the often brittle Bubba branches. \\xa0Either phenotype produces much larger yields than the Bubba, with the Tang Tang phenos being especially prolific. \\xa0The nugs produced are extremely dense, so bud mold can be an issue in higher-humidity environments. \\xa0The Tang Tang plants will stretch at least twice their height when flowered, while the Bubba-dominant phenos stay slightly more compact.\\n\\nNorthern California\\n\\nGrindhouse Medical Seeds\\n\\r\\n            Hybrid, depends upon phenotype\\r\\n        \\n70 days, depends slightly upon phenotype (Tang Tang-dominant plants at times take longer to finish)\\n\\r\\n            A stout plant that often finishes a deep purple, it came out of the Mendocino County medical scene and has been a mainstay on dispensary menus ever since.\\xa0 A musky Afghani smell and taste package with some hints of sweetness and dark fruit and an average yield.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Unknown, likely Afghani in origin\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Mendocino County, California (plant lineage is likely Afghani)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only, there is a seed version from BC Bud Depot which is a Mendo Purps IBL (inbred line) and a TH Seeds version called \"Da Purps\", which is Afghani x Mendo Purps\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid (some Sativa phenos exist)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            [Insufficient Data & Images in KR]\\r\\n        \\nBlueberry x Haze x Northern Lights #5Created by Herbal Wellness in Denver, CO\\n\\r\\n            Denver, CO\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nNamed \"The White\" for the color of the finished buds (which absolutely drip with resin glands), this strain seems to be somewhere in the Kush family but is thought to have come from Triangle, an elite Florida strain.

It was definitely Sativa-dominant during the initial effects part, but shifted gears heavily around the mid-way point, making this feel more like a 60/40% Sativa type of hybrid experience. The structure and texture were superb, while the rest of the \"bag appeal\" areas were only average. This one started off rather potent but seemed to tail off majorly, with the 2nd half feeling more like residual effects than anything. Overall though, we recommend this to mid-level patients who desire a smooth-smoking Sativa hybrid that won\\'t keep them at peak potency for too long while also providing some quality body/mental relaxation, possibly leading to sleep (we\\'d suggest it as a late afternoon/early PM strain).\\n\\r\\n            Unknown\\r\\n        \\nIn-house cross bred by Karmaceuticals in Denver, CO\\n\\nArrowhead shaped fern green calyxes, formed in loose open clusters, with burnt umber pistils, an average density of very long, thin-stalked trichomes with small heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomes and lithocysts.\\n\\nThough it wasn\\'t pungent really, the smell was a pleasingly fresh-smelling blend of pine (at times with a chemical bent to it), vegetation, and a light sweetness.\\n\\nThere just wasn\\'t much to this sample taste-wise — it seemed to mostly taste like smoke.

A pulsing, energetic feeling throughout the body (and radiating up into the head) combined with some burning in the eyes and a spacey mental state, making this one feel rather potent to start. Despite the energetic body presence, we had the urge to stay seated, partly to process the experience.

The #2 simply describes another phenotype, perhaps sprouted as a bag seed or modified backcross.\\n\\nClone Only phenotype of OG Kush\\n\\nFinished flowers still have a stickyness that OG heads appreciate. Thus the breakdown is less beady and sizable nugs must be grinded to unlock the magnificent flavor within the swollen calyxes.\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nThis is one of the real \"crusher sativas\" that almost mimics an indica couch lock with its oppressive head high. We\\'ve found this in other diesels as well. The popularity of the standard Sour Diesel has pushed forward the palette for various Diesel varieties. \\n\\nSour Diesel x Strawberry Diesel x NYC Diesel,\\n\\nSoily and slightly sweet in the jar, it breaks up to produce a fresh menthol-tinged soil scent when handled. It reminded one reviewer of freshly torn mint leaves… The pungency was pretty average, but it was enough to be noticed without being right near the bud.\\n\\nNot as tasty as we expected, it was a pretty standard Diesel type taste, with a soil tinge similar to what was presented in the smell. There were no traces of the NYCD or Strawberry Diesel influence with their brand of sweetness, it was mostly just a fuel and soil taste, but not a particularly pungent one. It burned down to a medium-light gray ash, showing that it had an above-average flush job.\\n\\nMajor cerebral soaring rush, facial and occular pressure building for 30 minutes or more. The head high stays put but disconnects the legs, so while a crushing sativa experience is had there is no real movement unless it is necessary.\\n\\r\\n            Sativa-Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Originally intended for outdoor cropping, Twilight is a 100% Indica Afghani that often turns deep purple when mature.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Afghani variety\\r\\n        \\r\\n            One of the original Dutch Passion strains, bred by Henk van Dalen in the 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Musky Afghani with a sweetness creeping in at times \\n\\r\\n            Spicy and smooth \\n\\r\\n            Heavy Indica effect, sedating and relaxing, with good sleep aid properties. \\n\\r\\n            Thrives outdoors but can also be cultivated indoors — expect large yields\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Afghanistan originally, later out of Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Dutch Passion Seed Company\\r\\n        \\r\\n            100% Indica\\r\\n        \\r\\n            About 53 days, anywhere from 50 to 55\\r\\n        \\r\\n            A combination of two of California\\'s most famous and popular strains, this one seems to have taken on the appearance of the Urkle with its radiant purple tones while taking on the OG Kush\\'s distinct flavor.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Purple Urkle x OG Kush\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Soil, fuel, and that distinct Kush scent (mix of spices, often described as similar to ginger ale). \\n\\r\\n            Much like the smell, it was definitely Kush-dominant, with an earthy tinge to it. \\n\\r\\n            Very relaxing and sedating, it was a bit of a creeper, not reaching its full effect for about 30 minutes.\\xa0 It was a \"down then up\" type of experience, with the effects lifting later in the duration and returning the patient to a normal state with a slight boost of energy.\\xa0 This strain is recommended for clear-headed yet effective pain relief, mental/physical relaxation, mood elevation, slight pain relief, and sleep aid in higher doses. \\n\\r\\n            California, USA\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Clone-only\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Urkle is a notoriously slow finisher for a heavily-Indica variety, and OG Kushes generally take about 9 weeks, so we would estimate around 9 weeks for full maturity.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Velvet Elvis x Haze (unconfirmed)\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Mostly earthy \\n\\r\\n            Pine and skunk-heavy \\n\\r\\n            A hybrid in the true sense, has strong components of both mental and physical effects.\\xa0 anti-anxiety, relief of minor body pain, and relaxation are the main attributes of this cross. \\n\\r\\n            Unknown\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Unknown, likely clone-based since no data is available for the strain online\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Sativa-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hindu Kush x Malana\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Hindu Kush is from the Afghanistan-Pakistan mountains, Malana is from India\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Barney\\'s Farm Seeds\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\nCrossed from ho-hum commercial strains (Afghani and Skunk #1), this plant was a bit of a surprise for Gerrit Slot, the owner/founder of Magus Genetics. \\xa0The plant shows some Sativa-dominant traits such as its high calyx-to-leaf ratio, its stretch after start of flowering, and its overall \"up\" effects.

The #2 designation is not anything permanent or reflecting upon the WiFi population at-large, but simply reflects the chosen plant number from this particular selection project. This cut has been gaining an incredible reputation in the elite genetics community, both because of\\xa0the Fire OG Kush (one of the most sought-after OG cuts to this day) and Krome\\'s The White (a less-rare but still elite OG-based cut out of Florida) — for Kush-lovers, it doesn\\'t get much better than the \"Wi-Fi OG.”\\n\\nFire OG Kush x The White\\n\\nBred by OGRaskal, released as a limited seed release\\n\\nWith a tight nug structure more reminiscent of the Fire OG than the large pinecone-shaped buds of The White, this particular WiFi has the perfect blend of density and attractive trichome/calyx structure, keeping thing open enough to see but possessing a very satisfying nuggy texture.\\n\\nThe Fire OG is definitely the predominant aroma and flavor present in this cut, with a perfect slightly spicy OG flavor rife with gingery citrus terpenes and a kerosene-like kick that comes out when it\\'s disturbed.\\n\\nThis is a strain which when properly-grown has a deep, abiding flavor which lasts through the end of a joint and leaves a lingering OG flavor on the lips and in the throat whick rivals some of the best we\\'ve encountered.\\n\\nWonderfully uplifting yet deeply powerful effect, which comes on strongly from the first hit and stays around for well over 3 hours. \\xa0It\\'s felt immediately in the face and eyes, but doesn\\'t make the eyes feel squinty or dry, but rather just provides a constantly pulsing pressure and warmth which is pleasant to most patients. \\xa0Mentally it\\'s just a strain that wipes away stress and tensions and provides a humorous, light-hearted mood elevation which is very smooth and without any anxiety or raciness. or raciness.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nLimited seed release/Clone Only\\n\\n\\r\\n            Indica Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\nWhite OG is one of the hardest hitting indicas in most collections. Settling in late during the curing stage, the terpenes present in White OG are subtle but very fruity. At harvest though, and when just packaged, the buds seem generic, albeit covered in trichomes. Give this a couple weeks in your jar and you can observe aromas build to a complex richness to be savored.\\n\\nThe White x OG Kush\\n\\nChrome\\'s The White is\\xa0predominant against the OG Kush it was bred to achieve this strain.\\n\\nCovered in trichomes, it is frosty-white as the name implies. Small, spherical buds are typical, with very little stem and particularly dense.\\n\\nMango fruit punch, when cured more than a month.\\n\\nThick, woody smoke, indicative of OG Kush, is typical and can be a bit harsh for new comers. Again, as the bud ages in the jar (and this isn\\'t just a generic statement) the flavors develop to an intense complexity. The trick is keeping a stash around long enough to experience this phenomenon. \\n\\nHeavy indica qualities, including ambivilance, loss of focus, body relaxation and if tolerance is low, body dissociation can result from a heavy dose.\\n\\nClone Only\\n\\r\\n            Indica-Dominant Hybrid\\r\\n        \\n8 weeks\\n\\r\\n            A cross of the award-winning White Widow with an Afghani to increase yields and add more of an Indica effects package, White Rhino is a stout and sturdy plant that hardly stretches at all in flowering.\\xa0 The Afghani genetics improve heartiness and disease/mold resistance while also shortening the flowering time slightly.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            White Widow x Afghani\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Coming off of the success of White Widow, Greenhouse seeds wanted to combine the notorious potency of that strain with something that yielded slightly more and was even easier to grow.\\xa0 The results of that breeding project is White Rhino, a more Indica-dominant version of the Widow.\\xa0 After the split of Greenhouse Seeds founder Shantibaba from the company, he re-packaged the strain as \"Medicine Man\", retaining the original genetics.\\xa0 Nirvana Seeds is known for creating versions of famous strains, and this is no exception — most people consider the Nirvana version of lesser quality and prefer the Mr. Nice version over any other.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Not really known for its flavor or smell, it\\'s mostly a musky vegetal smell. \\n\\r\\n            Hashy and a bit harsh normally, with some phenotypes/plants producing a more lemon taste. \\n\\r\\n            Very potent and resinous, White Rhino takes after its Afghani father, with a strong and sedative body effect that comes on quickly after first hitting the eyes.\\xa0 Borderline narcotic, it\\'s best as a nighttime or lazy day medicine, as it can become difficult to do much of anything while in its grip.\\xa0 Strong sedative qualities make this strain a good medical choice for mental and physical relaxation, anti-anxiety, sleep aid, and pain relief qualities. \\n\\r\\n            An easy-to-grow plant, it will do well in either soil or hydro, with soil bringing out the most flavor.\\r\\n        \\r\\n            South Indian, Brazilian, and Afghani — developed in Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Greenhouse Seeds, Nirvana Seeds, and Mr. Nice Seedbank (available as \"Medicine Man\")\\r\\n        \\r\\n            Indica-dominant hybrid\\r\\n        \\r\\n            8-9 week, with 9 recommended to unlock the full yield/flavor potential.\\r\\n        \\nCalled \"white\" due to its heavy resin gland content as well as its tendency to not fully color up when ready to harvest, White Widow is known for being extremely potent.\\xa0 A solid producer of connoisseur-quality nugs, it has been popular in Amsterdam coffee shops for many years and has been used in many breeding projects to increase the potency and vigor of other strains.\\xa0 While not an outstanding yielder, it stays relatively short and compact, making it a good choice for home grows.\\xa0 The males are said to be best for breeding because the females are not known for their smell and taste… the male will often lend the potency and trichomes of the strain while retaining the flavor terpenes of the chosen mother plant.\\n\\nBrazilian sativa combined with a South Indian hybrid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif (!window.AdButler) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\"script\");
