Beta-Myrcene,,anti-tumor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220615/,"This oil demonstrated a strong cytotoxic effect, which may be attributed by the presence of specific components such as the monoterpenes citral, citronellol, and myrcene. Furthermore, Nikolić and collaborators [11] investigated the antitumor activity of Thymus serpyllum, T. algeriensis, and T. vulgaris essential oils on growth of four human tumor cells. The specie T. serpyllum was the most potent in all tested cell lines and contains thymol as its major constituent, a phenolic compound known in the literature for its antiproliterative activity [12]. Therefore, the essential oils and chemical constituents are natural products with high pharmacological potential against various types of tumors.",,
