For lovers of Bubba Kush, this strain is a must-try, especially for the aroma and taste package, which is potent and reminds us of the best examples of that strain we've ever had. The effect is a little more uplifting and active than Bubba traditionally is, but this 303 still had quality body relaxation properties that made the incredible mood it put us in even more enjoyable.

Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x Reservoir ChemDawg IC3

Selected by Colorado's Hill Billy (and named for the common telephone area code, 303), originally bred by Zombo.









Broad, spade-shaped woodland green calyxes in open, tight clusters, with desert gold to heath red pistils, and above average coverage with very long, thin stalked trichomes with small heads

We were definitely "wowed" by the aroma that this Colorado-born cross possessed, as it was extremely pungent and reminded us of some of the best coffee-chocolate Bubbas we've had. There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we've encountered in some time. If you're a fan of the dank, spicy smells of Bubba Kush, this strain will likely surpass most examples of pure Bubba in your mind's eye, as it has in ours.

While it was nearly impossible to live up to the aroma, the taste did come close to matching it, though it lost some of the added post-grind complexity and was mostly Bubba in profile. One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the "greasy" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses — this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn't give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.

One word kept coming up during our reviews of this strain, and that was "fun" — this one just really improved our moods almost immediately, making us feel social, extroverted, and creative. It definitely felt Sativa in profile to start, increasing energy and bordering on racy at times (never anxious though), with a heavily buzzing body and pressurized face/eyes. The happy mood and relaxed body which made up the majority of the experience post-30 minutes wasn't conducive to working simply because we wanted to enjoy life more than concentrate on anything. This strain was great for some mind-wandering and following your fancy, so to speak. After the main potency passed around 1.5 hours into the experience, we felt more able to actually relax and concentrate if needed, and the body relaxation feelings increased.

Albert Walker is a legendary clone-only Afghani skunk variety, while Manic is also an old-school Afghani, though with a sugary sweet smell.  The combination of the two creates a hard-hitting yet very positive Indica hybrid that yields welland exudes a lemon-garlic aroma.

Albert Walker x Manic

This strain was named "32? (pronounced "Three-Two") because that was the number of the "keeper" female.

Pungent mix of lemon, garlic, and body odor funk when ground 

Spicy and citrusy, with a lingering aftertaste 

Though it's a strongly Indica-dominant strain, it seems to shift its effects depending upon mood and situation.  If it's midday and you're immersed in a physical activity, it'll have you feeling relaxed, happy, and capable — if you're medicating before bed, it'll ease you into restful sleep.  Potent effects package all-around; good body relaxation, sleep aid, relief from minor pain, and ocular attention.

This A.S.H. is an example of some classic genetic lines in perhaps the "trinity" of genetic lines, Afghani, Skunk, and Haze. The blend of these influences could be seen in all areas of the sample, from its structure, to its smell, to the effects. We all enjoyed this strain but saw potential for better medicinal-level duration and better flavor lurking within, namely due to what we see as a slightly early harvest and not-quite thorough enough flush. These flaws didn't do much to dampen the overall experience however, and the mix of uplifting and ground effects from the Afghani and Haze parts of this strain were an enjoyable tug-of-war that ultimately felt like a great hybrid. This is a good strain for those who appreciate the classic taste palate of Skunk and Afghani and desire a daytime mix of Sativa and Indica effects — we felt that the strongly cerebral and slightly rushy start would be a little much for inexperienced patients, especially those who suffer from anxiety or nausea issues.

            Afghani Skunk x Afghani Haze
        
Bred by Mr. Nice Seedbank

Claw-shaped fern green sepals in open, loose calyxes, with driftwood brown pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thin stalked trichomes with large heads

he staff's consensus favorite part of this sample, the aroma was a very classic-smelling mix of musky, skunky, garlicy, vegetal, and lightly fruity/sweet all at once. The lightly sweet and fruity Afghani musk it broadcasts in the jar is rather pungent, but it increases further when ground and takes on more of the garlic dimension as well, always with the Haze spice in the background.

Flavor-wise, this strain was again a mix between the almost putrid, lightly sweet, fruity Afghan and slightly sharper and spicy flavors. We didn't feel that the smell came through to the taste as cleanly as we would have liked, we think this is partly due to the Haze-style bud structure containing a decent amount of leaf cover, which brought added harshness and standard smoke flavor to the party. The thick smoke that results from this one was moderately expansive and did hit the lungs a bit hard, causing some coughing at times. 

We felt both parts of the lineage on this one pretty clearly, and it almost seemed to run the gambit of Sativa and Indica even between our review staff, with one member reporting heavily Sativa feelings, one somewhere in-between, and one leaning slightly towards the Indica side. The start was clearly Sativa and Hazy in nature, coming on rather strongly to start, but seemingly building over the first 30-45 minutes, filling our heads with pressure, our chests with a fluttery, light, borderline rushy feeling, and a slight loss of vestibular senses (felt like we were moving or spinning at times, especially with eyes closed). It definitely served to wake us up a bit with the potency, but it also cast a bit of a "sensory blanket" feeling over everything, and we just felt a little bit mentally slow despite the internal energy. Still, we were able to function in more creative and less detail-minded tasks, and the relaxation feelings increased as it rolled past 1.5 hours. The Afghani body effects seemed to come into play around the same time, serving to bring us back down after a rather 'up' beginning, but it never really made us drowsy or came with the crash we expected. A long, slow decline following the end of medicinal-level effects around 2 hours carried us out to about 3 total.

OG Kush

Abusive's OG (later renamed "L.A. Kush") is a special OG Kush cut thought to be a "selfed" OG bagseed.  The original grower was nicknamed Abusive, and the cut kept his name.  It was discovered and gained popularity in the Los Angeles area in 2002-03, eventually being spread via the Devil's Harvest Krew to other locales around the country.
It's a low-yielding OG with a distinct clamshell-like rounded calyx structure and copious trichome coverage.  The smell has elements of the typical lemon-lime pine cleaner OG, but carries more of a deep spicy quality than most OG cuts, lingering on the palate for some time after smoking.
Abusive's OG is very potent and has a more direct mental impact than many of the more clear-headed OG cuts such as the Ghost and SFV.  A "strong up, strong down" type of effect, it hits hard immediately but evens out into an eminently relaxing state of a mixed mind-body nature.  The main medical benefits are mental and physical relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and sleep aid on the comedown and in higher dosages.
The pictures above are the verified Abusive's OG cut, grown by Scott of Rare Dankness.  The plants were photographed growing live just prior to harvest, and then shot again post-harvest in dried form.

In the garden, AC/DC is a bushy sativa and grows akin to Golden Goat and Sweet Sweet. Its leaves are so thin they feel like feathers when you brush against them. Though many CBD strains are reserved for concentrates for their overwhelming tendency to self-polinate, AC/DC is a proven 30:1 CBD strain that holds well as finished buds and is very stable. 

Cannatonic Phenotype

AC/DC is a CBD-rich phenotype of Cannatonic. It has been tested at 30:1 CBD, just above the threshold of industrial hemp. This cut has been circulating through California for several years, and in some ways Charlotte's Web, another "pure CBD" strain has somewhat stolen its thunder.









Not your typical "Nebraska No-High" hemp plant, the cured buds are tight formed but fluffy. Very little kush structure and much more akin to skunk variaties with sizeable colas. 

AC/DC smells like lemongrass and cherries.

Cherries and berries are evident in a thick, woody smoke. 

There are just traceable amounts of THC in AC/DC and is as close to a "Pure CBD" whole plant as you can get. CBD has been demonstrated as a treatment for epilepsy in children.

From the land of hash-making varieties of cannabis, this Afghan Kush is one of the most resinous varieties on Earth, known for producing incredible "charas" and Afghani black hashish.  The plant shows a very strong traditional indica structure with large, wide, dark green leaves and thick, blunt-topped nugs.

Afghan Kush

Grown in the Hindu-Kush mountains of Afghanistan for centuries, this Afghani Kush subset of the indica family tree hearkens back to the purest of indicas.  Collected and made available in seed form primarily by Sensi Seeds in Amsterdam.  This variety was traditionally used in hashish production, but is also very valuable as flowers, with its large, resinous and gooey buds.

Earthy, hashy and slightly sweet, sometimes with notes of Pinesol.

Much like the smell, it sometimes has sweet hash notes, similar to the fragrant charas that is produced from this strain.

Moderate potency indica effects package that is heavy on the body relaxation and pain relief thanks to its resin content.

Grows with special vigor when started from clone rather than seed — growers who start from seed will see a large growth spurt as the plant enters into flower, thanks to the hearty Afghan vigor present.  Grows well in all mediums and even in harsh outdoor conditions thanks to its rugged lineage.

Afghanistan, from the Hindu-Kush mountains

Sensi Seeds is the most popular version, and it's sold as "Afghan Kush." There is also a version available as "Afghani Kush" from Next Generation Seeds.

            Indica landrace variety
        
Medium-Short, 47-55 days

A very stout and hearty variety that originated in the rugged mountains of Afghanistan, these dark green Indica plants can survive almost anything.  Pest and mold-resistant, easy to grow, and compact.  Traditionally used in hash-making, Afghani varieties are  often extremely resinous and sticky.

Afghani

Originally brought into the United States and Holland in the 1970's, it's been used in many crosses to improve yield, mold/pest resistance, and add its Indica power and resin production.

Normally hashy and earthy, sometimes very musky and spicy, at times overwhelming carbon filters.

Hashy and pretty unremarkable in most cases, sometimes the spicy notes or even light sweetness comes out.

Sedating and pain-relieving, Afghani varieties are known for being narcotic at times and eminently relaxing.  Known for fairly high CBD content, they have great analgesic properties.

These hearty plants are suitable for any type of cultivation and thrive even in difficult and cold-weather climates… they also thrive in SCROG and other training setups.

            A stout, resinous plant in the typical Afghan mold with a yield boost coming from the addition of the Skunk #1.  Mold and pest-resistant, it's a good choice for beginning growers.  It produces solid, heavy buds and is thus well-suited for commercial applications.

Takes after the Afghani #1 mother in structure and resin while adding some Sativa potency and head effects thanks to the Maui Haze father.  This blend of two old-school genetics lines produces a sticky, potent plant that stays relatively short throughout its lifespan.

Afghani #1 x Maui Haze

Appearing first in the California medical scene, this strain has some serious old-school credentials… the original Afghani #1 is a cut grown in California since at least the 1980's that was composed of several landrace Afghani hash-making varieties.  As a result, this hybrid picks some Sativa vigor from the Maui Haze, but otherwise displays its Afghani roots — it's a sticky, trichome-laden plant that is known for gumming up a grinder or two.

Properly-grown Afgooey will have a deeply sweet and fruity aroma with a background of pine and hash — the most common fruit note picked up is cherry.

Mostly hashy and/or herby, it sometimes produces a nice berry sweetness (much like the smell, it's a bit unreliable and largely depends on growing skill/technique).

With a relatively strong Indica effects package, Afgooey has the potential to be a "daywrecker", but at small-to-average doses, it's squarely in the functional Indica category thanks to the Haze influence.  Buzzy, slack extremities, a fuzzy mental state, and a definite couchlock tendency forms the core of the Afgooey experience.  It definitely lightens the mood in a goofy, slack-jawed kind of way, but is overall a "down" experience that is most conducive to seated activities not requiring a ton of attention.  Shows benefits with strong relaxation properties (both mental and physical), mood elevation, sleep aid properties (especially at high dosages), anti-anxiety, ocular relief, and mild pain relief.

Grows well in either soil or hydro setups, good for space-sensitive grows as well.

Medium, 55-60 days

Like a rollercoaster with a big first drop, this one was strong off the bat and then finished out much calmer. We loved the mixed nature of the high, and it felt almost equal in terms of mental and physical effects. The unexpectedly sweet and fruity taste and smell was a great addition to the effects. I'd recommend this to almost anyone, as it was balanced and not too strong… and may be our new in-house favorite "easy indica".

Dark green with slight purple hues, nearly invisible brick red pistils. Solid trichome count and large calyxes

Very complex and unexpected for a pure Afghani strain… the sweetness and multitude of smells was great. It was hard to describe, but I definitely got some dark fruity/berry notes, especially post-grind when the pungency skyrocketed.

 Similar to smell, berries that did not earth out like most sweet ones do, more like it hashed out slightly.

 Instant and extremely clean relaxed feeling but not the intense crushing indica takeover expected. Body went from tight and anxious to loose and calm with a pulsing from top to back of head. Very comfortable and very welcome start. It progresses to a really positive and happy experience, sometimes just causing smiles. Great mix of head and body, strong in both areas. It lets up quite a bit 1.5 hours in, but I was able to cook dinner totally pain-free and it never made me want to just sit around even though the body high was so present and relaxing.

Strong medication. The buzz really got me stoned and felt very discombobulated. The strong head high followed by a strong body high had me planted on the couch. I wasn't completely drained of energy, and it gave me a great tranquil ending to the buzz. After a long day at work grinding against major back pains, I will go to my stash and definitely fire up the AfPak.

Rock hard nugs that look like a ball of keif. Covered in yellow looking trichomes and compacted with lime green leaves and light orange hairs.

 Has a thick aroma that is very pungent. Kind of skunky, and smells like my nutrients - a pleasant mix of sweet and earth/pine. Makes me kind of dizzy, in a good way.

Very heavy smoke but goes in pretty smooth. Strong hash and earthy taste.

Gives me a very euphoric high leaving me feeling very happy and a little trippy at the outset. The sativa aspect of this hybrid act early and provide focus and clarity, but give way to a very strong narcotic state and makes it hard to function mentally. Makes my head feel really hot, and makes my shoulders feel real heavy. The indica is very dominant after about 20 minutes, where it induces couchlock and body becomes lethargic. Feels like a great blend of head and body buzz.

Local Orange Skunk x Jack's Cleaner x Space Queen

Originally created by Subcool in an attempt to fuse the legendary clone Jack's Cleaner with an orange strain, it was thought to be an attempt to make his own version of a Juan Moore strain called 7Up.









Swirling combination of lemons, oranges, and an almost liquor-like sharpness. 

Like spiced holiday oranges (the ones stuffed with cloves), leaves a wonderful orange aftertaste lingering in the mouth. 

Strong mood elevation properties with a quick onset — it can be a bit trippy and scatterbrained at times, a true sativa experience.  Ocular attention, mood elevation, and minor pain relief are the main medical properties. 

Grows well in soil or hydro, Subcool suggests topping them early and flowering quickly, as they get tall.

AK-47 used to be one of those elite strains that made everyone "ooh" audibly, but it has been knocked down a tier in the last few years with all the high-grade Kush and Diesel strains especially. However, this AK-47 x NL-5 was a good reminder that it's a strain to reckon with, as is the even older Northern Lights #5. It's very clear why these strains were chosen as a hybrid – it provided a superb blend of hybrid effects that seemed to satisfy a little bit of everything while maintaining its power throughout the duration. The smell is extremely unique but unfortunately doesn’t always translate to the taste. This old-school blend would make almost anyone happy (literally, it was an instant mood enhancement) and has the potential to help patients greatly with almost any disorder that they may have except for very serious pain.

AK-47 x Nothern Lights #5

Covered in orange-brown pistils, this strain almost had a yellowish hue to it that made it look less appealing than it actually was from afar.  It wasn't exactly covered with tall visible trichs either, so this strain would probably fly a bit under the radar for most people.  But upon magnification, its trichome coverage becomes apparent.

This strain unleashed a very unexpected blast of sweetness combined with a cocktail of spices, similar to what one would find in egg nog or mulled wine.  A variety of smooth and sweet smells from cinnamon to cardamom was the dominant aroma.  When it was ground up, it trended a bit more towards the standard citrus side with a vegetal sweetness, which when combined with the initial smell reminded one reviewer of candied orange peels.  Though it won't make you sneeze with its pungency, it was above-average in that regard and could be detected from a few feet away.

With  just a hint of the spices that permeated the aroma, this strain tasted mostly of a lightly sweet piney citrus with a bit of hashiness.  The taste was a bit ethereal, as it seemed distinct and fairly strong but then disappeared as quickly as it came, leaving us struggling to describe it in detail.  This strain gave us an incredibly smooth smoke that upgraded the overall taste score simply because it was such an easy and enjoyable smoke despite expanding quite a bit. 

Immediately after smokin, our reviewers found themselves in a quickly elevated mood and with a super heavy high behind the eyes that felt like they weighed 5 pounds each.  A spacey head and vibrating body were also part of the package, putting our review team in a great mood where they wanted to be as social as possible or pursue creative endeavors.  The body high seemed to move mostly to the feet/legs and filled them with a buzzing energy as it went on - our reviewers were pain-free during the review despite doing a variety of activities.  This was a fairly superb hybrid high that hit on almost every desirable trait of an MMJ experience, with no anxiety, paranoia, or other negativity.

An extremely powerful Sativa-dominant strain with an odd musky fruit-meets-chocolate taste and smell package, the ATF originated in Alaska in the 1970's but retains its popularity to this day.

Northern California Sativa and Afghani genetic lines, possibly containing Oaxacan Gold and/or Original Haze

Originally called "Matanuska Valley Thunder Fuck", this strain became popular back in the mid 1970's when High Times magazine did a story on the strain following the court decision that essentially legalized marijuana possession in Alaska.  Shortening the name to the more friendly Matanuska Thunder Fuck, the strain eventually became known as Alaskan Thunderfuck by the non-native speakers who heard tale and traveled to Alaska to experience it for themselves.  Originally a much more Sativa-dominant plant, it had more Afghani bred in for heartiness.  The original clones went underground following DEA raids in the 1980's, at times being protected by the Hell's Angels.

Musky fruit with a light sweetness 

Much like the smell, it has lightly sweet but musky fruit flavors and an interesting smooth chocolatey quality 

Overwhelmingly potent at times for some users, the ATF packs a strong Sativa punch that uplifts the mood but often leaves the user with no ability to do anything other than hang on for the ride.  Strong body relaxation and mood elevation combine with appetite stimulation and ocular relief to make ATF a particularly medicinal Sativa. 

Flowers late and long outdoors, but normally speeds up when grown indoors.  The structure has definite Afghani influences, but the flowers tend to be foxtailed with thick, ropey pistils that retain their thickness and prominence when dried.  ATF will take rather strong feeding and produce well.

            Thought to be an old Afghani Skunk
        
            Albert Walker was made popular at Grateful Dead concerts throughout the 1980's and 1990's, but was thought to have originated in the Pacific Northwest earlier than that.  The structure and scent suggests that it's an Afghani Skunk, but nobody knows for sure.

            Coming on strong with a wave of heat to the head and chest, Albert Walker uplifts the mood and provides a good deal of mental energy at first.  It changes it character after a short time though, turning into more of a euphoric and relaxing Indica effect.  Good body relaxation, anti-anxiety, mood elevation, and appetite stimulation qualities. 

            Albert Walker is a finicky and demanding strain that is tough to grow, requiring heavy feedings to maintain healthy growth.  It yields well and is very rewarding if properly treated though.  Possibly due to the old age of the clone, it is very difficult to clone and grow, but makes great breeding stock.

The Alien Dog is a terrific indica based strain, stemming from one of the most popular strains making its way across the country (Alien Technology). We recommend using small samples of this for medicating, as the more you ingest the larger the head/mind effects become and it seems to detract from the brilliance of the body medication. On the other hand, seasoned patients may enjoy the diversity the strain offers and choose to go "all in" for both mind and body exhuberation. 

Alien Technology x Chemdog D

Bred by Cali Connection

Light green, almost yellow from trichome coverage

Floral citrus pre-grind with some definite soil/kush smells after grind along with the same citrusy smell that was present originally.

A soft sweetness (berry/pine) with delayed, albeit big, expansion.

You feel it heavily in your head and face immediately (upper jaw and teeth were kind of tingling and numb), with a buzzy warm body high feeling, but everywhere. Definitely stronger than most right off the bat, you can feel that trichome coverage in a real way. You almost have trouble focusing your eyes, it's very strong and a little disorienting. It definitely has an indica profile, the pulsing warm high all over the body and head is really something, repeated yawning and stretching.

The Alien Kush adds some indica punch, dark coloration, and further trichome coverage to the already legendarily-potent and tasty Tahoe OG Kush clone.

Tahoe OG Kush x Alien Kush (Las Vegas Purple Kush x Alien Technology), the Alien Kush male is Alien Technology-dominant

Alien Technology is a very special landrace Afghani strain that was brought back fairly recently by a U.S. soldier from an unnamed small village in Afghanistan.  The other parts of the equation are Kyle Kushman's Las Vegas Purple Kush and the original Tahoe OG cut, which many believe to be the original OG.  This cross was made by Swerve of Cali Connection.









Spicy, with notes of piney vegetation, and soil — it has hints of sweetness from the LVPK as well. 

Piney sweetness with a hint of Kushy spice that hangs in the back of your throat rather than hitting the tongue at the forefront. 

Starting off almost rushy at times, the sativa nature definitely comes out early in this cross.  Very strong ocular attention and facial/head pressure made it feel a little overwhelming or bleary at times despite its clear and even-handed mental state.  The relaxed body and thoughtful, philosophical mind-state this strain provides makes this one good for quiet conversations with friends, reading, or being creative.  Overall, it feels like a pretty even hybrid, bringing out more of the indica as it progressed.  Recommended for ocular attention, general relaxation, joint/hand pain, migraine relief, and possible benefits with ADHD/ADD and other attention disorders.

It carries a solid potency for a fruity named strain and can be enjoyed sitting or on the go. It has a talkable nature, but also gives a nice introspective experience to the patient.

 That banana taste lingers in your mouth. Very sweet and pleasant.

This was a classic Indica body buzz, focusing its effects in the chest region (some feeling heavy and others feeling expanded or full). The sample provided quick results with some dizzy or light headed effects for the initial 5 -10 minutes.

A nicely balanced package of Indica effects without many of the downsides often associated with them (tiredness, inability to function, etc.).

It was almost hard to see the strain underneath all the light strawberry-colored pistils that seemed to cover 90% of the bud's surface. Underneath though, there were a good amount of trichomes, and it was slightly more impressive than to the naked eye. 

 Mostly sour and citrusy (as is expected with a NYCD cross), this strain was pleasing to the nose and also carried notes of soil along with a slight vegetal sweetness that came out especially after grinding.

 Lingering sweet & sour pallete

This strain caused immediate warmth and a radiating feeling that coursed throughout the body and face as well as an alternative heaviness and lightness on the chest. Seemingly not able to make up its mind, we vacillated between states of energy and sloth, but felt slightly spaced-out the entire time. The one constant was the relaxed and numbing body high, which kept us pain-free and in a good mood. It was above-average in potency, but never got overwhelming, making this a good choice for almost any level of MMJ patient effects-wise. Definitely an Indica-dominant experience, we were left a bit on the sleepy side after it was over, but it finished clean overall.

Bred by Green Dream Health Services, Barrington is the result of a desire for a louder voice on the wonderful Bubba Banner.  The smooth lavendar/grape aroma and terpene profile of the GDP was the desired trait sought to work alongside the near perfect 50/50 hyrbid high of the Bubba Banner.

The dry bud has a slight purple tint to it, looking more like a prevelant grape ape cut mixed with some OG light green from the Banner genetics.  The bud structure is more akin to the OG family tree than the stalkier Bubba and GDP relatives.

Wet or dry, Barrington closely resembles the GDP in aroma.  The cross yields a more pungent scent, but did not change the overall character of the GDP in doing so.

Sweet grape over light pinene, followed with a nutty exhale.

True to its reason for being created, Barrington provides a very mellow indica experience with enough hybrid nature to be an all day medicine or recreational smoke.  The Bruce Banner heritage ensures it will be potent for everyone, the cross doesn't lend itself to be an axienty or paranoia inducing strain.

This strain takes an A+ strain and adds a terrific new kick. The Fort Collins Cough (Northern Lights #5 x Haze #17) was one of this editor's personal favorites while attending CSU in the mid-late 90's because of its potency mixed with clarity. It was always a highly functional sativa hybrid that was only missing an exquisite flavor and scent. The BB#3 brings that to the table with perfection. The only suggestion KindReviews has for this strain is a new name… beauties like this deserve their own calling card!

The coloration was magnificent, greens, oranges, purples, and more. The trichome count was very high and the density was perfect.

The Bruce Banner takes over this smell, which is fine with us as it brings forth so many great scents. You will find soft fruit and soil, as well as a common diesel scent with pleasant earth and pine tones.

This is perfect in our opinion - a split of taste between the fruit/diesel of the strain itself and the organic matter it derived life from.

Initial soaring effect, very potent characteristics for mind, head, body core and extremeties. There is no missing the onslaught of medicine from every angle and most patients will take 5 minutes to gather their bearings. You will then notice the sativa activity as you get an energy rush and mental euphoria. The indica traits keep the shoulders and back relaxed even as the sativa continues to deliver. This is strong medicine.

Though this strain is a sativa, it hits like a ton of bricks and definitely takes after its mother, the head-knocking Original Diesel, an east coast favorite. There are a few different phenotypes of this strain available, but the most popular is the #1, which is the most Diesel-dominant and has reportedly tested at 25%+ THC on several occasions. Biesel is kicking around at several dispensaries throughout Colorado, and it's definitely worth a look for patients who like a more stony and sedative sativa with a complex Diesel bouquet.

It has quite potent head effects to start, doing the normal Diesel thing and filling the user's head with pressure and a buzzing sensation, and causing the mind to wander off at the slightest distraction.  This excited and cerebral initial effect quickly drops into a much more "blank slate" feeling, where the mind is really just processing information and the user is not doing much interacting — it's suitable for movies and other passive entertainment, but anything active would probably be a little too much.  The body effects are a strong muscle relaxation and the tendency to remain seated due to the general comfort level this med provides.  Strong appetite stimulation and ocular effects signal "Sativa", but the overall tenor of the experience is more along the Indica lines past the initial 30-45 minutes.It has quite potent head effects to start, doing the normal Diesel thing and filling the user's head with pressure and a buzzing sensation, and causing the mind to wander off at the slightest distraction.  This excited and cerebral initial effect quickly drops into a much more "blank slate" feeling, where the mind is really just processing information and the user is not doing much interacting — it's suitable for movies and other passive entertainment, but anything active would probably be a little too much.  The body effects are a strong muscle relaxation and the tendency to remain seated due to the general comfort level this med provides.  Strong appetite stimulation and ocular effects signal "Sativa", but the overall tenor of the experience is more along the Indica lines past the initial 30-45 minutes.

Big Bud is known to be a weaker strain that many growers use to up the yields of more interesting strains, yet this Big Wreck is very potent. Indicas are so good for pain and relaxation, and when you find one that still allows for mild conversation it is a real plus. New patients should go slow when medicating, don't smoke a whole joint or you will find yourself with unprovoked guilt and paranoia.

Trainwreck x California Big Bud

Very fuzzy, light green with amazing trichome count. 

Mild pungence giving a "designer soil" scent.

Fresh produce, a mild purple sweetness that stays in the mouth for a while.

Fast acting, but also a 10 minute steady rise. Focus in forehead upon first ingesting, then a cool and calm body. This is a powerful indica that will wash away most everything going on, best to sit back and relax in the sun or in front of a TV. Not overly introverted which some powerful indicas tend to be.

Holy foxtails, Batman! These nugs were all weird-shaped and each had at least one columnar foxtail reaching out from the main bud. Also unusual was the purpling, which seemed to affect half of a foxtail but the other part was dark green… unique indeed. 

Definitely Diesel-dominant, it's a skunky fuely stank that also has some slight citrus notes, as are often found in both of the parent strains. After a grind, more of the light sweetness and citrus came out, pushing the fuel to the background.

A slightly sweet and mentholated fuel taste was the dominant one going in, but it left a bit of a pine or hickory-like aftertaste.

Tears welling up in the eyes (partly due to coughing) and a near-immediate heart-racing feeling started this one off strong, feeling like a pure Sativa at first. Lots of ocular pressure fluctuations and a definite spacey mental feeling carried it into its peak stage about 25 minutes in, where a detached and slack-jawed mental state collided with mood elevation and physical energy (but no desire to actually get up and do something with it). Two reviewers moved onto a very "crushed" state where it was a struggle to stay awake and functional in the world, while another (smaller dosage) didn't report that feeling. So that leads us to believe that the higher dosage may put this into the crushing category… try it out and see which amount works for your body type and needs.

Powerful. A good 5 minutes after medicating I felt an initial rise in energy and heart rate. After 10 minutes I felt that the 5 hits I took might have been too much. Thankfully that feeling didn't last throughout, and not long after I came to a more sustainable level at 80-85% of its peak intensity.

Arrowhead-shaped barley corn green sepals dappled throughout with eggplant purple, in closed, tightncalyxes, with ochre pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thick-stalked trichomes with average heads

This sample had a typical (in the best way) Purple aroma. It has a perfume-like smell that reminded us of fancy soaps, with just a hint of fruity sweetness. The aroma was very enjoyable, but required some coaxing to really come out, and was never all that pungent.

The flavor was more sweet and fruity than the aroma was, with a definite grape element. It wasn't very pungent beyond the first hit or two, but the smoke was smooth and not harsh on the throat. There was moderate expansion though, and multiple reviewers reported some coughing at the end of the review portion as the smoke became very thick.

This strain came on quickly, after 2 or 3 hits it sent a wave of pressure into the eyes and head, and a buzzing sensation in the feet and shoulders. A calming sensation came over our staff, putting the mind at ease, but making us a little slow-witted. It was more suited to stationary activities like watching a movie or (if you can keep your eyes open) reading a book, and we didn't feel the desire to leave the house at all. The effect got somewhat tiring as it progressed, with strong muscle relaxation and heavy eyelids making it easy to go curl up for a nap. It was a smooth decline in effect, but multiple reviewers ended up falling asleep before the effects were completely gone.

 For our reviewers who were experiencing a lot of stomach discomfort, it did wonders for relieving that, and everyone really enjoyed the numbing, relaxed body effects as well. It's definitely a berry-scented strain, but that didn't translate to the taste. Still, the pleasant smoking experience again made up for that shortcoming, making this a perfect selection for patients who need an Indica but don't like the thick, at times cholorophyl-laden (since they generally have more leaf matter) smoke they deliver… "pleasant" was the word that kept coming to mind with this one.

            DJ Short's Blueberry x Afghani
        
 Though the lineage would suggest a more dense structure than the result shows here, we liked the foxtailed and unpredictable structure. Light green and looking like the DJ Short's Blueberry side of the family, it has brick red pistils and a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. 

 This sample reminded us both of a purple strain and Blueberry with its slightly musky but sweet berry aroma — we did indeed pick up a Blackberry element to the smell as well. It was more piney and musky pre-grind, but sweetened up quite a bit and got more pungent once handled.

Lightly sweet and spicy in the mouth, this strain didn't have a ton of taste to it. The smoke was incredibly smooth and non-expansive though, making this a superb choice for those who don't want to cough. 

 With only a little ear tickle and some face/head pressure to start, this one came on rather slowly and built into a uniquely relaxing body-centric experience within 45 minutes. With a lot of downward inertia serving to pull us into the couch, the warming and relaxing body effects came with very little mental effect other than a pleasant sense of relaxation (mental processes were clear). As time moved slowly forward, the numbing and tingly body effects kept up at a high level, especially in the hands and arms. One effect that we all noticed was strong relief of stomach issues and increase in appetite, which came on almost immediately. As it subsided, we were generally a little tired and this med would definitely pave the way for a restful night of sleep.

Compact, purple-tinged flowers with average resin coverage

 The high point of this strain for sure, the aroma was a wonderfully pungent mix of sweet blueberry and sharp, musky, putrid elements… which, yes, can be described as smelling like cheese. It's a very strange and unique taste that you really only find in Cheese strains — alternately appealing and revolting, like many fine cheeses 

 The taste took on more of the cheese elements than the smell did, while the berry sweetness fell to the background. One reviewer commented that there was even an iron/mineral-like taste, similar to what is found in very "goaty" cheeses, while others mainly picked up on peppery, sharp notes. The sweetness was still present, but the sharp tastes were stronger for sure. 

We had one outlier reviewer in our results that had a very uppy, motivational experience full of energy, exaggerated hand motions, and laughter… this contrasted with the experiences of the other reviewers yet was repeated on a secondary review, so we felt it worth mentioning. Sometimes meds simply affect people differently, so keep that in mind with this one, as we don't normally have one review sticking out so much from the others.The majority of staff felt that this was a wonderful relaxing med that served to take all the troubles and pains of the day and put the brakes on them. Starting off with a buzzing, warm body, strong forehead/temple pressure, and an immediate mood elevation, this strain felt really potent early on. It was a torquey med that stayed at medicinal levels for around 1.5 hours, only tailing off around hour 2. The dominant state was one of engaged but inactive focus, where the couch and a movie or video games were the perfect accompaniment. It was a great "stealth med" though, as the reviewer's physical appearance was unaffected despite the potency. A soft drop (or perhaps a rise, since it was a "down" med overall) back to sobriety made this a smooth experience overall.

 It seems as if the AK-47 has bulked up the trichome count on the Blueberry, as this sample arrived caked with cloudy-headed trichomes, alongside a healthy blend of light greens, and mixed autumn-colored pistils.

The DJ Short's Blueberry really comes through here — notes of blueberries, strawberries, mint ice cream, and a slight sour element that comes out after the grind. If you like a sweet, fruity strain, this one's right up your alley. It's very nicely pungent as well, one of the stronger-smelling fruit varieties we've had in some time.

While not quite as pungent and overwhelmingly sweet as the smell, the taste still had a clear berry flavor with hints of earth, flowers, and vegetation. It wasn't a particularly enduring or pungent taste, but was enjoyed by the staff. The staff unanimously agreed that the smoke was very smooth and not too expansive, making this a good choice for patients who don't wish to cough or otherwise have respiratory issues. The final ash was a little iffy-looking, with a charcoal/gray mix, indicating that it may have needed a more thorough flush.

A rush of heat to the face and eyes started things off, with an accompanying relaxation and warmth coming over the body as well. The eyes and cheeks especially felt the effects of this medicine, though it didn't seem to physically affect them, as they were mostly clear and wide open. It showed some mood elevation properties in our review staff but was not euphoric by any means — it seemed to be a measured positivity that depended a bit on the incoming mood. The dominant feeling on this med was that of worry-free relaxation with a definite couchlock/lazy quality to it. This would be a good choice for a lazy day or an evening, though it wasn't so strong and lethargic to make it tough for daytime/busy use… we could focus when necessary.

Sweet and floral berry, often with a hint of citrus-sandalwood sharpness from the Haze.

Much like the smell, Blue Dream's flavor is a floral berry with some almost 'purple' notes at times (grape, flowers) — some expressions are heavy on the floral, almost hitting a lavender note.

Very uplifting and cerebral, it takes mostly after its Haze father — but in the background exists a strong sense of body relaxation and quality pain relief.  Energetic and aware to start, Blue Dream's potency may still catch some consumers by surprise — there are some rushy tendencies early on.  The strain evokes lots of creative energy despite occasional bouts of scatter-brained distraction, and at times the user will find themselves in a state of near-euphoria.  Solid body relief seems to increase as it goes along, building until it becomes more of an indica feeling to finish; warm and relaxed, with the patient completely at-ease.  We recommend this strain as a daytime or early evening choice, a great way to take the edge off of the day and relax the mind and body for a restful night of sleep as the effects decline.

Blue Dream normally grows bigger in hydro, but gets the best flavor in soil.  It grows slow at first, but once it gets kicked into flower it will stretch a bit and will branch out more than it did initially.  Training helps to maximize yield, but the dense, rounded nuggets this strain produces will weigh heavy and reward a skilled grower with a very above-average yield.

The Blue Hawaiian is a great looking strain with plenty of red hairs to add on to its marvel. A bit leafy on the outside, but the inside is packed full of sparkly trichomes. The buzz has a great balance of both head and body high, and a beautiful look and smell to match. Personally, the only down side is the medication is not as strong as I usually like. But, there is always a place and time for this type of smoke.

Bred by Jordan of the Islands

These flowers are simpy beautiful inside, covered with shiny trichomes and giving wonderful colors - lots of light greens and oranges.

Smells fantastic. Smells of blueberry with a slight bitterness.

Smells fantastic. Smells of blueberry with a slight bitterness.

Uplifting medicine that gets me motivated yet eases my nerves. Very mellow and not too stoney, with a great body medication present as well. The Blueberry provides the relaxing and pain relieving indica and the Hawaiian adds just enough sativa to allow fluid operation during the medicating process.

It's somewhat rare that a strain's qualities live up to its name in all areas, but this was certainly one of those. This was our first experience with Blue Kush and we all found it to be extremely enjoyable, exotic, and something we'd all happily go out and buy. The appearance, smell, and taste were like the two strains were combined in a lab — perfect fusion of sweet fruitiness and Kush spiciness and elements of each strain's structure. We found this strain to be very relaxing and medicinal without being overbearing or sending us into a withdrawn, sleepy state like many Indicas can do. Perfect daytime (or evening really) Indica relief, though complicated tasks might rub you the wrong way when you really just want to enjoy the strain's comforting body effects.

Bred by Dinafem Seeds

Arrowhead-shaped cucumber sepals with seaweed green accents, tight clustered calyxes, with cumin-colored pisitls, and above average coverage with short, thick-stalked trichomes with average heads

The fusion of Blue and Kush stood out in the aroma, with the pre-grind smell presenting more of a piney Kush quality, while the post-grind smell unleashed a wonderful sweet and sour berry. This one seemed to change almost at random — you smell it one moment and it's all sweet berry, but the next it has clear Kush spice notes — this is a complex and engaging strain with a great pungency level.

Though it was less pungent and more ethereal than the aroma, the taste was much the same and continued the perfect match of Blue and Kush. We again noticed that the flavor seemed to shift and mutate as we burned away the sample, at times being sweet berry, at times sour berry, and sometimes all Kushy spice. We all enjoyed how the flavor changed and the overall complexity, as well as the endurance.

The effects built smoothly over the initial 5 minutes or so, resulting in a mentally alert yet strongly medicated state where the body felt very relaxed and warm. We kept calling this one "expansive", as it seemed to improve our mood as well as gave us a floaty, pulsing body that felt as it was growing from within. Social and positive, we were reaching out for company but kept gravitating towards more relaxing and less-technical activities that allowed time for contemplation and respite. This even-handed and smooth state continued at a high level for a full 2 hours, which is a longer medicinal-level staying power than most — the effect declined rather quickly at approximately 2.5 hours and lingered out to 3.

Said best by one of our reviewers, "I'm not usually one for meds that close off the outside world, but this Blue Widow was damn nice. I felt right at home and truly enjoyed my own company, what a great strain."

Blueberry x White Widow

Bred by Dinafem Seeds

The Blue Widow looked very pale and sugary to the naked eye.

The sample was very pungent with a scrumptious blue candy over a sweet fresh pine scent.

The BW was just a tad harsh but not bad, and packed a big expansion. It tasted much like the smell with a sweet berry tone that was very pleasing.

The Blue Widow makes no bones about its indica nature and immediately delivers a calming wave. Pressure and stress melt away leaving the mind in a comfortable solitude and the body in a flacid state. Conversation and outside intrusion (TV/Radio/Computer) were found to be somewhat unpleasant but still performable if necessary. The couch and a book, or a towel and the sun, are where your mind and body will want to park and enjoy the long, relaxing ride.

            Indica Dominant Hybrid
        
Blueberry [Thai Sativa (Oregon Purple & Juicy Fruit) x Afghan Indica]

Pretty stereotypical Blueberry — bright calyxes, dark green leaves, and orange pistils. Average in almost every sense, it was dense enough to be substantial, dry enough to burn well, and covered in a moderately dense layer of trichs. 

Yep, this is Blueberry… this sample had that perfect sugar-coated muffin smell and was rather pungent both pre and post-grind. After the grind, a slightly musky and putrid sweetness came out, taking over for some of the sugary berry. Simply put, if you like Blueberry, you'll love this smell.

A tad disappointing after the sugary bouquet, the taste was a little more subdued, with only one reviewer getting the beautiful candy berry/muffin type taste out of it. It seems to be in there, but coaxing it out wasn't easy for everyone… there was an earthy element to it as well that came out in later hits. Rather smooth and not particularly expansive, this one was an easy smoke.

A very smooth and linear experience overall, this strain started off with some light Sativa effects such as eye/face/temple pressure fluctuations, but also immediate relief in the neck and shoulder blade area. With elevated moods, this med took us on a relaxing ride that left us feeling capable the entire time and never overly medicated or fuzzy. While it was more prone to sitting activities, the muscle relaxation and pain relief made active ones enjoyable as well. A strangely enduring face feeling persisted well into the 2nd hour, and the eyes seemed to get redder as the experience went along rather than vice-versa, as is normally the case.

            Indica Dominant Hybrid
        
One of the most unique-looking plants we've had the pleasure of photographing here at PotGuide, "the Bob" (as it's also known) is a freak confluence of quality genetics which produced a plant which is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. Combining the signature Hanis nail polish/acetone-meets-chocolate aroma and flavor with the Sativa growth pattern and yield of the S.A.G.E., Bob Saget is extremely resinous and has almost no leaf aside from the actual fan leaves. The effects are uplifting and borderline racy at first, but mellow out slightly into a lightly psychedelic, but still buzzy experience, before crashing out at the end as many strong sativas do.
Bob Saget is great for very mind-engaging activities such as creative tasks or video games (easy to get "in the zone" with either one) but not quite as great for conversations, as the mind-racing going on inside the head often overrides the conversation with others. As it winds down, the mind becomes a little slower and a soft cloudiness sets in, while the body also seems to relax from the near-frenzy of activity which constitutes the first hour of effects.

Ft. Collins ("FoCo") S.A.G.E. (Big Sur Holy x Afghani) x Hanis (Kunduz Afghani purple pheno x [Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x 1994 Positronics Haze])

This strain was created by master breeder Tierra Rojo (of New House Seeds) during the summer of 2010.  The Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. mother is a very Sativa-leaning phenotype of that strain, finishing around 11-12 weeks and producing massive, bract-stacking colas — that cut was intentionally pollinated in early flowering by a Hanis plant which threw a couple of male flowers after being stressed late in flower due to hard flushing.  The resulting pollen only managed to produce a scant 6 seeds in the S.A.G.E. mother, only one of which was planted.  The rest of the seeds from this original cross have been lost to history, but the spectacular seed that was planted has hung around in clone form, being held tightly by a very select few in the Colorado area.  The name of the strain came from a sloppily-written plant tag which appeared to read "SAGET" rather than "SAGE x" and just stuck because everyone thought it was funny.

Bob Saget is an almost otherworldly-looking plant, taking strongly after both the 1994 Positronics Haze and the Ft. Collins S.A.G.E. with its large bracts and lack of leaf coverage — it often grows in stacking columns of bracts with an outstanding coating of trichomes, which appear to grow in cornrow-like formations, often fitting together much like the teeth of a zipper.  The plant is normally a greyish green color, but takes on tones of the Hanis' rich purple as it finishes, at times coming out almost entirely purple-gray in color thanks to the trichome coverage.  What little leaf matter is present on The Bob is practically shrouded in trichomes, including the undersides of leaf surfaces, which are featured in the photo album above.

Perhaps the Bob Saget's most signature trait, the aroma certainly takes most strongly after the Hanis "father" plant, blending a complex, sharp chemical scent which almost resembles acetone with a slight sweetness.  The initial inhale tends to bring more of the sweetness, but as the buds are broken apart, the acrid paint thinner side comes out very strongly, tingling the nose like few strains can.  The Bob (like Hanis) is almost not recognizable as cannabis scent-wise because it is so strange and unique.

Much like the aroma, the flavor at first has hints of sweetness and a unique floral element, but the aftertaste which lingers on the palate and in the throat (similar to Bubba Kush or Flo) is all Hanis superglue-chocolate funk.

Bob is an interesting Sativa in that it has such a strong Indica influence genetically, but the plant itself is extremely Sativa in growth pattern.  This dichotomy shows in the effects, which start off very Hazy, cerebral, visual, and energetic, and then covert into a stoney, sedate, mind-wandering state that borders upon a "crash" later in the duration.  Bob is one of those strains that you can smoke again an hour later and get right back to where you were, and the ceiling is rather high as well, with little tolerance buildup due to regular use.  Due to the relaxing second half, it's normally best as an early evening strain, though smoking on it all day will keep the user's mind active and stave off the typical Sativa crash which often comes as the 2nd hour of effects approaches.

Bob flourishes in coco coir with a well-aerated mix (coco-perlite sandwiches, for example) and relatively heavy feeding.  The plant stretches a fair amount when kicked into flower, but isn't one that will get so tall it falls over under its own weight or anything.  SCROG or similar training is recommended to maximize yield, and heavy feedings early will set a solid foundation for lots of bract growth and a more dense structure.  Moderate to light organic feeding normally results in a fairly airy plant, but one with an incredible aroma and flavor, as well as some of the largest individual bracts you will see on cannabis.

9-10 weeks, depending on effect desired

As with many of the high-THC% samples we've had, it seems that the potency mostly translates into a longer duration rather than a "woah!" type of experience to start — this Bogglegum carried on for a very long time (especially at higher doses) and held its potency at an above-average level for quite a while. If the peak potency were a little higher, it would've been an easy A, but it just didn't grab all of our review staff with its effects, which were mostly just base relaxation and a slight uptick in cerebral activity. The grow was nearly flawless, the sample was rather beautiful, the smell and taste both were above-average and enjoyable… it was just one of those strains that might never get into the upper-echelon of modern medical cannabis, as this seems to be pretty much its genetic potential. Try it out if you like a fairly functional Indica with a sweet soil taste that holds its potency for a long time — it's recommended most for intermediate patients.

            BOGBubble x Northern Lights #5
        
Bred by Bushy Old Grower (aka BOG)

This Bogglegum was totally loaded with fat-headed trichomes that seemed to hit just about perfect harvest timing, with plenty of visible ambers. The frosty appearance made the buds look almost white in the hand, broken up by occasional darker green leaves and red/orange/yellow pistils.

A sugary, slightly creamy sweetness is the main bag/jar smell, and we can definitely see where the bubble gum comes into play. After grinding, a most robust and musky smell comes out, with notes of soil, earth, and vegetation overtaking the sweetness for the most part. It was an average pungency sample, neither stinking up the room nor going unnoticed.

Two reviewers struggled a bit to get a good taste read on this sample, but the one who seemed to get the most picked up on a taste that was very much similar to the smell, namely a soil-dominant attack, followed by a sugary, floral, sweet quality that lingered on the tongue and in the throat. Though the taste was great, it was a bit elusive — still, the smoke was extremely smooth yet expansive.

This was a fairly cerebral Indica, keeping us mentally aware the entire time despite being rather strong overall and flirting with overwhelming feelings at its peak. Concentration on only one subject was difficult at times, but our thought processes were clear and vivid throughout the experience. The initial onset came on heavy, with a warming sensation throughout the body and head/eyes and a buzzing headband-like feeling — we all thought our eyes would be red and low, but they were relatively open and clear… good "stealth" med. The Bogglegum seemed to have a mood stabilization effect with us, keeping the mindstate even-handed and calm. The body relaxation carried on well into the latter part of the duration, and overall this med held onto its potency better than most, lingering into hour #3.

This phenotype of OG Kush is believed to originate in the early 1990s in Southern California. It is perhaps a bagseed of the original OG, also known as Hell's OG or Tahoe OG. Then again, that's just one story on OG out of many legendary fables. 

Also kown as Snoop's OG, this particlular phenotype is thought to originate in the mid 90's amongst the proliferation of West Coast hip hop. B-Real of Cypress Hill calls it Brain OG, probably after the song "Insane in the Brain", and Snoop calls it Snoop OG.

Bruce Banner #3 is the most potent overall of the three most popular Bruce Banner phenotypes. A strong OG Kush influence but some added raciness and fruitiness from the Strawberry Diesel; and #5 is Strawberry Diesel-dominant, taking strongly after that strain in structure and flavor.

OG Kush x Reservoir Strawberry Diesel (Strawberry Cough x Sour Diesel)

Originally bred by "OG Ironlung," the mystery OG Kush (now thought by those involved in its creation to be Ghost's OG Kush) was pollinated by a Reservoir Seeds Strawberry Diesel, and there were three main phenotypes that stuck around.  #3 was thought to be the pick of the litter.

Banner #3 has a deeply spicy lemon-lime OG Kush aroma with a slight hint of sweetness that sneaks in at times.

The flavor is much the same as the aroma, but adds a strong element of earthiness (like actual soil) and the sweetness takes a backseat.  The flavor is much the same, but adds a strong element of earthiness (like actual soil) and the sweetness takes a backseat.  

Banner's effect seems to depend largely upon harvest time, with an early harvest making for a very cerebral and borderline rushy experience, and a later harvest giving a more relaxing effect.  Generally it starts strongly sativa, with lots of eye and face pressure, a floaty, buzzing body, and an increase in heart rate.







The energy it gives is easily channeled into productivity, making the Banner a suitable daytime strain, though its potency is often too much for professional situations, especially for those who suffer from anxiety.  The second half takes on a more relaxed feel, with more of the clear-headed relaxation that OG Kush is known for.

Bruce Banner #5 is a Strawberry Diesel-dominant phenotype, taking strongly after that strain in structure and flavor. However, this phenotype is differently-structured and much more Strawberry Diesel-dominant than other varieties of Bruce Banner.

OG Kush x Reservoir Strawberry Diesel (Strawberry Cough x Sour Diesel)

Originally bred by "OG Ironlung", the mystery OG Kush (now thought by those involved in its creation to be Ghost's OG or Coal Creek Kush) was pollinated by a Reservoir Seeds Strawberry Diesel.

The nugs turn out more spear-shaped than the #3, with slightly larger calyxes and the typical thin Diesel structure.  

The aroma is very citrusy with a kiss of fuel and some background OG spice, but when ground, it's almost all citrus funk.

A little lighter than the #3 overall, Banner #5 is a fairly typical Diesel in terms of effect, especially if taken prior to the development of lots of amber trichomes, when it can take on the "crusher" quality that Diesel gets with a long flowering time.  Uplifting and cerebral, it's great daytime medication for creative pursuits and light work, serving to ease the nerves and stimulate the mind (and appetite).

Part of the "Banner Collection" bred by Green Dream Health Services in Boulder, Colorado.  The goal of this cross was to bring back some of the more true OG funk taste and smell while maintaining the Bruce Banner potency and increased yield.  Having received the coveted Brain OG (aka Snoop's OG or Soul Assassin's OG) from a long-time friend of Snoop Dog in late 2012, the Green Dream founders knew immediately it was a top candidate for the Banner Collection project.

The structure of the live plant is very OG dominant, stretching and producing relatively few flowering sites per foot of vertical growth.  While the growth is all OG, the flowers themselves are more conical and spear shaped like the Bruce Banner nugs. Large OG calyx/sepal structure remains, as the pictures clearly show.

Lemon, pine dominant.  The Bruce Banner comes through in the dried flower, presenting an earthy mineral component similar to the city after a fresh rain on the pavement.

Very lemon kush dominant, with undertones of earthy soil and minerals.

Hybrid natured with an intense potency from the Bruce Banner #3, the Brainer, as it's often referred to, brings the standard OG body high and laid back head but also adds a good hour or more of a traditional sativa experience as far as energy and vibrance go.

Any system works but this plant loves height and performs well even at the 6+ feet level.

We got multiple reports of a sweet fertilizer taste, even a dark berry hint, but overall it was agreed that while the flavor was still very pleasant it was certainly the weakest mark of the group.

A cerebral, enlightening feeling hits almost instantly while body heat, perspiration, and heart rate all noticeably increase. As the the medication sets in the mind and body begin to move in slow motion. The sativa and indica effects in this strain seemed at constant battle, trading dominance back and forth. Half way through a slight couch or chair session are in order as the indica emerges. Towards the end one regains mental sharpness and finds motivation. A nice surplus of energy emerges as you hit the road to sobriety.

Bubba Kush is a strain with a thousand stories behind it. While not as lore-intensive as an OG Kush, Bubba Kush tends to bring about heated conversations across the cannabis world.
While we've had the opportunity to speak with "Bubba/Matt" who tells a tale that stems from connections in Florida and ties the Bubba to OG heritage (Triangle to OG bag seeds), we've come to understand that its true genetic origins are unknown.
Bubba Kush’s specific leaf structure, stem thickness, density of flower sites and limited node spacing, and dark hues make it stand out in any garden. Specifically speaking, it's known for large bud structures with hues ranging from purple to green.

Katsu Bubba - orgnkid was the first to bring Bubba online that we ever saw. That was around 2000/2001 at cw. he was touting it, showing fat stacks of cash, his grows, etc. As far as we've been told, he sold a cut of Bubba to GCM and GCM sold it to Katsu. That is the Katsu cut, aka, orgnkid's green phenotype. Orgnkid first obtained this Bubba around 2000/2001 and got the OG slightly thereafter. Mint Bubba S1- ECK06's s1 phenotype from the first batch of Bubba Kush s1's orgnkid posted to the bay. Purple Bubba S1 - This is a cut orgnkid scored from a SFV club owner that was an s1 of the original Bubba cut the owner of the club sourced (whichever that is). The club owner was scared of the dudes he got it from and knew not to break their rules. But there was a way around it so he could make cuts and buds available to his club. So he makes some s1 seeds from the Bubba, pulls out the yielding, club nugget purple Bubba pheno. Now he has an "unheld" cut of the Bubba. THE REAL PRE-98/PRE2K1 - in 2004/5 or so we obtained the above purple and green bubbas from orgnkid through a mutual friend. We also got a cutting from our good friend in norcal (the true pre98).







For the sake of everyone online that had different cuts back then, we put some info in a Bubba thread much like this one where we grew all three of them side by side and compared. We labeled the orgnkid/katsu the GREEN PHENO/2k1. We labeled the ClubS1 the PURPLE PHENO/2k1. And we labeled the Norcal one, pre2k1, because at that time, we hadn't asked our buddy ALL the info on the norcal cut.. And we were told orgnkid's were obtained in 2k1. So anyways, after a few more pages in that thread at CW, people started getting the pre98 moniker from the kalimist mixed up with the pre2k1 bubba designation. So after probing our friend, he told us he got it from a glassblower in socal around 1998. After posting that, the pre2k1 pretty much started getting called the pre98. The pre-98 is shabud's cut. Swerve's Pre-98 - We don't know where swerve obtained this cut, you would have to ask him. But he has told us that he termed his "pre98" because the cut he obtained, reminded him of the the Bubba he was smoking in 1998-2000 in SFV.

Very thick flowers ranging from dark black and purple to green depending on the "cut" of this strain.  Remaining constant, Bubba produces Kush style cannabis flowers leaning from golf balls to swollen hearts in shape.

The aroma of Bubba Kush is one of those unique scents you will never forget. It often borders on an acrid ammonia smell, but always emits deep, earthy notes. From hints of coffee to dirty feet, Bubba Kush hits the nose a bit differently for everyone.

Depending on the pheno you may receive chocolate notes to ammonia notes, but regardless the smoke with be thick and heavy.  Flavors range on the earthy and bodily spectrum (yes, gross for food but lovely for cannabis) and well grown Bubba should provide flavor through water and the end of the bowl.

Heavily narcotic effects, with the Katsu cut being a bit less sleep inducing although still a very heavy body high.

Grows well in all mediums but veges very slowly.

8 Weeks on Average

With its long list of medicinal properties, its very good duration, and solid overall potency, this Bubba Kush S1 comes highly recommended for patients seeking a relaxing Indica experience that keeps you mentally clear and capable, even energetic at times. The grow quality was very high, with no visible flaws aside from the loose manicure, a great selection of colors, and plenty of well-timed trichomes. While we didn't like the super-sharp smell and taste quite as much as we do the more standard Bubba, it was certainly unique and served to mark this S1 variant as distinct from its parent. If you're a fan of Bubbas, be sure to give this one a try, both because it provides many of the qualities you know and love, but also because it adds something a little different to the equation.

The Bubba Kush has been released in self-pollinated, feminized form by multiple seed breeders, including Cali Connection and Riot Seeds.

blend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, but it had a sort of primordial, prehistoric look blend of dark green, purple, and those distinctive brick red thin pistils, with big, dark water leaves giving a primordial, prehistoric look to the flower. Trichome coverage is above average, on long average width stems with extremely large heads.

Though not exactly appealing in the sense that we want our houses to smell like it, this Bubba was certainly impressive and pungent. It gave off a very strong acrid smell that reminded us of other Bubbas at times, but that classic scent stayed more in the background… the main smells reminded us of a tire shop, fuel, glue, and musk, all very acrid once it was ground or broken up. Pre-grind it was more classic Bubba, with the dark almost coffee-like notes… those nearly disappeared once it was handled.

The taste was rather complex, seemingly changing as it cycled through the mouth. Initially it had the sharp rubber + fuel taste from the smell, then once in the mouth it turned sweeter and had more of the traditional Kush notes (spice, citrus)… the finish was spicy, citrus-tinged Kush. The smoke was smooth on the attack but very expansive, so it may cause coughing on bigger hits. The final ash was a speckled very light gray, showing it had a very solid flush before being cut.

Our overall experience with this Bubba was one of mental clarity and heavy relaxation. Kushes are known for their mentally-clear effects, and this one was no exception, as we felt completely capable and able to focus despite the Bubba trying to pull us into the couch. The initial effects were an immediate buzzing warmth throughout the body, with a strange relaxed energy and a heavy forehead/eye presence, which felt as if it were hanging over the brow and more weighty than normal. The early effects also came with a rush of thoughts and some visual alterations… in all, a potent start that had one reviewer forgetting about the rest of the bowl. After those early effects died down, a pervading sense of relaxation came over us… there was some couchlock, but overall it wasn't pushy or overwhelming. The comedown had us feeling a bit tired and ready for sleep.

One of the more lastingly potent strains to appear early in the Colorado medical marijuana scene, with a torquey power that continued through almost 2 hours after a 15 minute "creeper" delay. Bubba OG is a great strain for relaxation and mood elevation properties, making it a superb late-night relaxation strain — its Bubba qualities come out later in the duration and can make it a great segue into sleep when medicated a few hours before bedtime.

Bubba Kush x OG Kush

Thin cylindrical nugs that screamed "kush" to the review staff.  Above average density sample that shimmered when the LED was cast its direction.  Its blend of greens and long slender orange pistils gave it a classic look…

This one could almost be mistaken for a Diesel with its fairly acrid fuely twang, but it's still Kush-dominant for sure, exhibiting an array of soily, musky smells.  It wasn't pungent or even that noticeable until it was ground, which released all the aroma.This one could almost be mistaken for a Diesel with its fairly acrid fuely twang, but it's still Kush-dominant for sure, exhibiting an array of soily, musky smells.  It wasn't pungent or even that noticeable until it was ground, which released all the aroma.

A near-perfect fusion of the two standard tastes of these strains, it was primarily a spicy, herby Kush taste but one reviewer picked up definite Bubba notes of that signature dark chocolate/coffee musky, bitter quality.  It possessed a long aftertaste as well, hanging in the throat for 5+ minutes after medicating.  The knock on this one was the flush, which appeared to be too short, as the ash was a murky medium gray with some dark chunks remaining.A near-perfect fusion of the two standard tastes of these strains, it was primarily a spicy, herby Kush taste but one reviewer picked up definite Bubba notes of that signature dark chocolate/coffee musky, bitter quality.  It possessed a long aftertaste as well, hanging in the throat for 5+ minutes after medicating. 

Drooping eyelids and strong, tingly body waves (one reviewer described it as a "melting feeling") to start as well as a very strong presence behind the eyes and in the forehead, which felt like outward and inward pressure alternately.  This strain seemed to change slightly based on situation — when required to get up and be active, it went along with it — but mostly, the urge was to sit and enjoy the medication while retaining an active and fairly clear mind.  Strong mood elevation properties with this one had us laughing at everything and enjoying the company of others… great after-work relaxation and late-night calm activity strain.  It dropped off finally after about 1:45, which is among the longest initial potency durations we've seen… it was very potent up until that point.Drooping eyelids and strong, tingly body waves (one reviewer described it as a "melting feeling") to start as well as a very strong presence behind the eyes and in the forehead, which felt like outward and inward pressure alternately.  This strain seemed to change slightly based on situation — when required to get up and be active, it went along with it — but mostly, the urge was to sit and enjoy the medication while retaining an active and fairly clear mind.  Strong mood elevation properties with this one had us laughing at everything and enjoying the company of others… great after-work relaxation and late-night calm activity strain.  It dropped off finally after about 1:45, which is among the longest initial potency durations we've seen… it was very potent up until that point.

Definitely in my top 10 favorites for day time medication, and is crossed with one of our favorite strains Bubba Kush. A very tantalizing smoke that emits plenty of delicious aromas, and the Train Wreck mixed in makes this an enjoyable medication. The grower deserves our respect for harvesting such an aromatic and interesting strain. It smokes beautifully, revealing countless different flavors, has beautiful shelf appeal and is a very good medicine.

            Bubba Kush x Trainwreck
        
Very fluffy light green buds with plenty of long, straight orange hairs. The look has a Hawaiian structure, and it has plenty of glistening trichomes dripping off the nugs.

Extremely complex aroma coming from this medicine. All types of sweet berries, orange, skunky, and menthol smells.

Taste is like the smell. Absolutely exploding with so much scrumptious and indescribable flavors, but kush (sweet candy menthol) taste is distinctive on exhale.

Has great expansion and the effect is very potent. The bud hits very smooth and delivers a fast, clear cerebral high. Very euphoric and psychadelic, but with the accompanying numb body common from indicas.

Bred by Sagarmatha Seeds

A classic, sticky dark green indica with very fat, bubbly calyxes.

Very sweet, can easily pick out the Bubblegum scent. Moderate pungency.

Bubble gum dominant, sweet not berry. A bit harsh and induced coughing. Flavor was only found on "green" hits, not real strong. 

Strong body high, almost immediately. Provided a very heavy experience, eyes and head. Strong couchlock and space-out tendencies, which increased an hour in. This was not a "clean" experience, rather a heavy and somewhat muddled one.

            Indica Dominant Hybrid
        
A special seed release for the 2010 High Times Amsterdam Cannabis Cup (it was planned as their indica entry, but there weren't enough dried buds around before the competition to enter officially), this pet project of lead breeder Swerve came about in an attempt to re-create the clone-only legend Bubba Kush in seed form. An unknown male (possibly Swerve's SFV OG Kush F3 which he used for many breeding projects) was used in this double backcross, first pollinating on the mother to create seed, then another male from that population going back to the Bubba mother once more to reinforce her traits. The resulting plant grows much like the Bubba mom, but some variation in structure (some phenotypes will have long, slender nugs which is unusual for Bubba) is to be expected. However, the majority of nugs are the stereotypical Bubba pine cone/golf ball shape with large calyxes and that signature purple-gray coloration coming on as harvest approaches.

Pre-'98 Bubba Kush BX2

Swerve planned this as his 2010 Indica entry for the Amsterdam Cup but was not able to get the nugs ready in time for the festival, so he simply did a special seed release instead.

Deep coloration that looks almost gray from a distance is this strain's trademark, and the deep Bubba roots are seen clearly in all aspects of appearance other than the more slender, elongated nug shape which appears in certain phenotypes.  Trichome coverage is excellent, and it appears that this strain would make some high-yielding and quality extracts, judging from the copious amount of trichomes all over the leaf surfaces.

A creamy, slightly sweet coffee-kissed aroma with a herby edge is the primary one while the strain sits undisturbed in a bag or jar.  However, when it's ground up, the coffee/chocolate comes out a lot more, as does the musky, herby, hashy backnote which recalls the strain's deeply Afghani/Pakistani origins.

Losing some of the sweet qualities from the aroma, the flavor is mostly musky and hashy, with a lingering note of coffee.  Its smoke is moderately thick and moderately expansive, neither sending the patient into coughing fits nor hitting the throat without impact.

Taking a few minutes to really kick in, the effects felt predominantly Indica in nature, providing a warming body sensation and pulsing waves which radiated throughout the lower extremities, arms, and torso.  A slowdown of mental activity accompanied by an overall feeling of ease and contentedness overtakes the user after about 15 minutes, leading to a placid, happy, experience that's very smooth in nature.  The eyes get slightly heavy at times (even early on), but the effect never really becomes a "daywrecker" to the point where it makes the user fall asleep when they wouldn't otherwise or makes the mind cloudy to the point of losing functionality.  Bubba BX2 helps with both mental and physical relaxation, specifically muscles, but it does so without clouding the mind.  It also aids with minor pain relief, appetite stimulation, and has definite anti-anxiety properties.  Medicinal-level effects last around 1.5 to 2 hours, while the overall effects linger out to nearly 3 hours.

Production growers will find that this strain can produce reasonably well in hydro and coco setups.  However, the best flavor normally comes out in a soil grow using light fertilization regimes — the old-school feeding preferences of the original Bubba are intact here, and that means steady but relatively light feedings.  If a better yield is desired, the plants can be effectively SCROG'd, producing a collection of fairly large rock-hard pine cone tops instead of a slightly larger central cola.

Bay Platinum Cookies x Grand Daddy Purple (GDP)

This strain was created by Grand Daddy Purp’s Breeding and Development Team out of California. Candyland is a mix of Bay Platinum Cookies and Grand Daddy Purple – two renowned California strains. The mother, Bay Platinum Cookies, is a sativa dominant Cookies cross also created by Grand Daddy Purp genetics. The father is Ken’s proven Grand Daddy Purple male. Candyland can be cultivated both indoors and outdoors. This strain won a gold medal at the 2012 KushCon. The strain is most popular in California and Colorado.









Candyland produces tight, dense buds – generally circular in shape but depends on phenotype. The color ranges from shades of green to nearly 100% purple. Buds are coated in beautiful orange hairs and trichomes. The plant itself can be stretchy and viney like many Cookies cuts or short and bushy like the Grand Daddy Purple father.

Depending on the phenotype, the smell can range from sweet candy and grapes, to earthy, chemy and fuely – or somewhere in between. The Grand Daddy Purple father is famous for passing along its pronounced grape and berry aromas. The Bay Platinum Cookies mother is known to have that classic Girl Scout Cookies aroma with an added bit of sweetness from the Bay 11.

Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Candyland generally has a sweet, musky, fuely smell. It is also known to have earthy undertones. Those growing from seed will have the option to choose their preferred flavor profile – some will lean more towards the Cookies and other will be closer to the Grand Daddy Purple.

Candyland is known as a mood enhancer that is good for pain relief, managing muscle tension, and relaxation. The high can be more balanced like a hybrid or more sativa dominant depending on phenotype. Although it can be sativa dominant, it is not known to be racy. With THC levels reaching 19%+, the strain can be very potent. Candyland induces feelings of mental focus while providing relief throughout the body. This strain can be effective in treating depression, pain, anxiety, and ADD.

It never was overtly potent and despite lasting a long time, we sort of lost track of the effects at times because they were mild and unobtrusive. In many senses, this is a good thing (this was a pretty clear-headed med suitable for a day of work), but we think that this one is best saved for newer patients and those seeing moderate relief which last a long time but doesn't ever feel pushy.

            Snowcap x OG Kush
        
Slender spearhead-shaped wasabi green sepals, tightly opened pinecone calyxes, with frequent bursts of saddle brown pisitls, and above average coverage with average-length, thick-stalked hooked trichomes with average heads

While the aroma wasn't particularly pungent, it did develop a bit when ground up, releasing a crisp, clean, sweet pine-citrus aroma that definitely brought to mind Snowcap and other similar strains (NL #5-Haze, Jack Herer, etc.).

Softly sweet and piney, the flavor was fairly similar to the aroma on the first few hits, but declined from there and just because neutral and smokey. It never really tasted bad, but the flavor just disappeared rather quickly — we think that the dryness level may have had a lot to do with the way the flavor declined, as well as the way the smoke tickled the throat. The flush certainly wasn't to blame for any harshness, because the final ash was mostly white with some black flecks, showing a very quality flush prior to harvest. This one ultimately just fell short of its potential.

A moderate pulsing throughout the body and limbs was the signal that effects had begun, coming on rather smoothly and creeping up in potency over the first 20-30 minutes. While we didn't really feel much of a change in mental energy or mood, but rather a gentle relaxation which had us able to concentrate on non-interactive activities, but fading out a bit when deep concentration and attention was required. Several members of the staff commented that this med was almost invisible at times throughout the experience — it's certainly not a "punch in the face" type of med, but rather a smooth Sativa that kept us between mood elevation and relaxation with no negative effects or abrupt comedown. Some staff were left wanting more peak potency, but the duration was very good, lingering out to over 3 hours for all of our staff.

There are two or three versions of Cat Piss. One story (SoCal Cat Piss) says it is a bag seed from the legendary TrainWreck, the famous old school Northern California powerhouse sativa. Others claim Cat Piss (NorCal) is closer related to an Afghan landrace with heavy indica effect. Yet another Cat Piss is a Super Silver Haze cross but it is less circulated and unpopular.

Absolutely beautiful in so many ways, Charles' Kush is definitely an incredible herb. The effects caused by this medication are exactly what many people search for in an indica dominant strain. The smoke is super smooth and really thick; like blowing out clouds of Kush. Great bud to leaf ratio, and our samples were extremely well manicured. 

(Hashplant x Northern Lights) x ([Hashplant x Northern Lights] x Kodiak Gold)

Bred by Reeferman Seeds in the late 1980s

The flower is sparkling with milky white trichomes, packed full of dark red-hairs. Medium green colored packs, with hints of dark-purple. Some phenotypes are known to turn very purple or have stronger odors.

Has the pungent smell of kush. The aroma is not as strong as some other strains I had, but still very captivating.

Incredibly smooth smoke. Great taste of kush, with a piney after-taste.

Hits real fast and feels like it slows time. Makes you feel a bit "light-headed", sativa type of headiness at first and slowly turns to its indica dominant side with great relaxation throughout the body.

There is a very interesting back story about the cut available outside of Realm of Caring. It is not technically the famous Charlotte's Web, also known as R4 when it was selected from the Stanley Brothers breeding project. It is actually R5, a sister seed from the same project with the exact same parents. Almost an identical twin, R5 has a very similar growth pattern and cannabinoid spectrum to R4. Hence, it is still called Charlotte's Web just as there are numerous Chem Dawgs, Skunks and other strains that are ordered numerically.

Charlotte's Web was made famous by Charlotte Figi, a child who experienced a dramatic decrease in the frequency of her seizures after consuming cannabis oil extracted from this strain. Charlotte's Web grows like a pure Afghan, short and stout with non-fibrous stalks. Ironically, it as far from the traditional hemp sativa structure as you could achieve, but the flowers are still CBD rich.

Flowers smell like purple candy Now-and- Laters.

This strain has been demonstrated as a nerve protectant and has been used in the treatment of epilepsy in both children and adults.

Chem 91 x UK Cheese

Circa 2009/2010 Sonoma County [Chem 91 x UK Cheese Male(Amsterdam)] Infamous #12 pheno

Cheesel has a strong cheese fragrance by namesake with diesel fuel overtones. 

Cheesel tastes very rich and skunky with a heavy bodied smoke that lingers on the tongue after exhaling. Whereas the UK Cheese is noticable more on the aroma, the diesel flavor accents the Chem '91 lineage. 

Cheesel is an indica dominant hybrid that delivers a rounded effect of dissasociation from the body. Focus is made quite difficult while on this strain and is best used after work or daily responsibilities are through.

One of our veteran staff called this one of his favorites of this year effects-wise, ranking it in the upper echelon of potency and rating both the smell and flavor a 9+. Not all of the staff were quite as enthusiastic about the flavor and smell, but the effects were universally enjoyed for their energetic uplift that only had a tiny edge of anxiety to it early on — great balance of energy and comfort. This was a thoroughly enjoyable medicine, and we felt that it fits best for the daytime, especially a day off when you can really appreciate and indulge in its mind-expanding and mood-elevating effects. One reviewer commented that this was as much a recreational "fun" med as a medical one, while another got great relief from back problems and nausea, so it seems to show a versatile nature.

Spearhead-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in clustered stacked calyxes, with bursts of dark burgundy pisitls, and supremely covered with above average-length, average-stalked trichomes with large heads

Pungency was the name of the game here, and this sample was easily-noticed, whether it was sealed in a bag or not. The dank rubber-fuel-skunk front notes has a background of spice and citrus, making for an almost overwhelming scent package before it's even ground up. The post-grind aroma brought to mind a bit more of the Sour Diesel, with a stronger kick of fresh citrus and an almost floral quality once it settled. This strain is one of those that is a matter of personal preference — most of our crew loved it, but it is a challenging scent like most Chem and Diesel strains.

The pungent aroma translated directly to the flavor, which again was Chem-dominant, with a Sour Diesel-influenced citrusy finish. Deeply spicy with notes of rubber, skunk, and chemical cleaner on the inhale, the exhale left an almost anise-like flavor on the lips, and a fuely scent in the nostrils. Again, this whole family of strains are a bit of an acquired taste, but Chem and Diesel-lovers will certainly appreciate this example's flavor. 

White this strain's effects were felt immediately with the increase in face/eye/head pressure and temperature as well as heart rate, we all felt that it was at its peak between 30 minutes and 1 hour into the experience. The time of day seemed to affect the results of the reviews, as the reviewer who sampled the strain at night felt it shift gears around the 1 hour point to a meditative relaxation, while the daytime reviewers got a lasting boost in energy, mood, and physical activity. The surging energy was felt throughout the body and kept us up on our feet, at times pacing around smiling for no reason in particular. It wound down for most of the staff around the 2 - 2.5 hour mark , but left a lasting feeling of energy and focus, unlike some Sativas which give a drained, "crash" feeling as they fade out… a worthy ending to an overall very satisfying experience.

This strain will certainly leave an impression with you… whether it's something you'll come back to is entirely personal preference, because it's definitely not for everyone. Patients who suffer from anxiety, cardiac issues, or cannot handle extremely potent Sativa effects to start may want to steer clear of this one, because it's not to be trifled with. The aroma and appearance both were outstanding, and the flavor was very solid as well — again, the olfactory qualities are an acquired taste, but Diesel and Chem-heads will absolutely love it. while we found some medicinal qualities in this strain (primarily ocular effects and pain distraction due to sheer potency), this one felt like more of a cerebral mind-expander type of strain than anything; truly one for the Sativa-lover who wants to experience raw power.

Likely bred by Colorado Alternative Medicine in Denver, CO

Wide spade-shaped clover green sepals arranged in clustered spiral calyxes, snaked through by shocks of mahogany pisitls, and supremely covered with average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with large heads

If aromatic pungency is what you're looking for, this is a great choice. Even from 5 feet away in a sealed baggie, this sample could be smelled, and when it was broken up, it somehow even got more pungent, to the point where it was almost a nose overload and we could only smell it for short bursts. The combination of skunky fuel, gun oil, rubber, hints of citrus, and garlic is something to behold, and really should impress anyone — the catch is whether or not you actually like this acrid and powerful of a scent, which is entirely personal preference.

The sour and somehow sweet combination of fuel, chemical pine, citrus, and spice in this one was amazingly tasty on the early hits, leaving a strong lingering flavor in the mouth and sinuses. Beyond those early hits, it was a fuel-spice lingering flavor which never took on negative qualities. It's worth noting that one reviewer reported the qualities of this strain his mouth and sinuses for up to 40 minutes after smoking — it definitely stays with you.

Early potency is this strain's calling card, and it absolutely jumped all over us to start, feeling almost like a high-grade extract rather than a strain. Our eyes felt like they were bulging, the forehead felt as it was expanding laterally and outwards, and our entire bodies filled with a fluttery, borderline frantic energy (major increase in heart rate). The energy translated to the mental state as well, which would be a flurry of random thoughts and sensory impressions, but then would seem to blank out, where we'd get lost staring at a random object, etc. Very potent start with this one, and even up to 1 hour we felt it was still almost at its peak effects (all reviewers were 8.75+ in potency rating at that point, very unusual). It was almost disorienting, and we found ourselves 90% immobile despite the frenetic internal energy. Music was something that we all seemed to enjoy at a high level whole reviewing this sample — the mind was expanded and ready to intake a variety of stimuli, but somehow unsure what to do with it all, making it more like pure sensory input with very little back-end processing. Beyond 1 hour, it began to unleash its grip and we were more able to focus on one thing at a time and the at times anxious mood calmed down. This sample did leave us feeling a little drained, as most meds with such a strongly Sativa start tend to do.

Most research shows a large fog cloud surrounding all true origins, but once you've smelled Chem Dawg you know it's a building block in much of what you pick up today. Chem Dawg is an amazing strain, used for so many other wonderful varieties you are familiar with like OG Kush, Sour Diesel, to name a couple.

"Dog Bud" (unknown) Bagseed (S1/F1)

Colorado growers P Bud & Joe Brand were growing a strain they alternately called the "Dog bud" (because it was said to make the smoker roll on the ground like a dog), and the "Chem" weed (because of its unique almost chemcial funk).  After turning on an East Coaster to the strain on Grateful Dead tour, they stayed in touch, and later sent some herb East to their friend.  In one batch, the recipient found seeds, which would later be known as the Chem line (Chemdog [aka Chem 91], Chem B [aka SistaChem], Chem D, and Chem 4).

Very light coloration from trichome count.  A great middle road density.

Sour, chemical pine, sweet, soil.

Similar flavor to Sour Diesel strains as this is a major component of that strain - sour, soil, floral, and the famous chemical/fabricated Pine Fresh scent.

Fast acting, the sativa dominant traits lead to a clear, head-based effect.  The medicine delivers itself quickly, but also climbs for a little while before going full-force.  This is a talkative medicine, but with enough indica to not acquire the racey edge.

            An increasingly strong energetic body feeling, eye/face pressure, and a rising heart beat seems to grow and grow until reaching a peak at nearly 45 minutes into the experience.  This peak is borderline uncomfortable at times, and not for those who suffer from anxiety issues.  The latter part of the effects are a bit crushing, inducing couchlock and causing lots of yawning and stretching.  A real "up then down" experience, it seems to disappear all at once (at about 2 hours 15 minutes).  Recommended for Sativa-lovers who can handle the bucking bronco-like initial effects — it provided quality appetite stimulation, physical energy, and would certainly chase off fatigue.

This one really impressed us with its raw potency to start, and had one experienced reviewer contemplating if it was the strongest start he's ever had (flowers OR concentrates). That said, the potency may simply be too much for many patients, especially those who are prone to anxiety due to some physical manifestations of this sample such as a racing heart and sweating. Even for our experienced staff, we found ourselves bordering on disoriented and unable to do much of anything for the first hour. The power held within the effects were certainly hinted at with the smell and taste, which were both very pungent and acrid — Diesel and ChemDawg connoisseurs will love the bag appeal of this one.

            ChemDog x Bio-Diesel
        
Arrowhead-shaped fern green sepals, arranged in open stacked calyxes, with dispersed small patches of raw umber pisitls, and well above average coverage with long, average-stalked trichomes with large heads

If you're a patient who at all likes the acrid, fuely, skunky end of the cannabis aroma spectrum, this strain will make your day. This is one of the strongest-smelling strains we've encountered in some time, both in overall pungency (both pre and post-grind) and in terms of the "impact" the smell has on the nostrils. Fuel, skunk, hickory, garlic, body odor, and just a hint of citrus (after it's ground) are the dominant notes on this one, and "dominant" is exactly the right word to use to describe them.

While the taste (like the smell) isn't exactly appealing to many people, it certainly is impressive in the same way as the aroma. Thankfully, the acrid skunkiness is toned down in the flavor a bit, with mostly the fuel, spice, and smoky flavors coming through, with the spice lingering as the aftertaste. 

This one was a very fast starter, coming on almost immediately with strong effects. Most of our staff began sweating and had a very noticeable increase in heart rate, which could really prove to be too much excitement for those who suffer from anxiety issues. Along with the racy internal energy it provided, it sent us into a flurry of random thoughts and ideas, making it hard to concentrate at times, as if the raw ideas received little to no processing prior to entering the mind. In short, we felt rather "crushed" and unable to do much of anything, preferring to simply sit (or lie down) and hang on for the ride, at times having our legs fall asleep from sitting in the same position for too long. As it finally began to drop in potency around 1 hour, the effects became more functional and elevating, but not in the traditional happy mood elevation sense, but rather more of a heightened state of sensory awareness and internal energy. The effects continued to dwindle through 2.5 hours, simply lingering on from that point.

Adding some punch to the fairly cerebral Haze, this hybrid is a thoughtful combination of strains that starts off with a bang.

ChemDog x Super Silver Haze

Male is reported to be Shantibaba-era Green House Super Silver Haze (#7 phenotype?). 
This cross is different from "ChemHaze" aka Dawg Daze, which is Chem D x Sensi '93 NL#5 x Haze 

Acrid citrus, chemical pine and cleaner — it is normally Haze-dominant, with only some body odor-like funk as a reminder of the ChemDawg mother. 

Much like the smell but adding a unique "cool" eucalyptus and some flowery/soapy notes, it again is Haze-dominant. 

With a bit of a sledgehammer start, this strain contains a variety of strongly Sativa effects, with the requesite head/eye/face pressure fluctuations, a tingly body, and a slightly rushy edge at times.  Once the initial slam wore off about 1 hour in, it dialed in to a fairly functional and social state that felt mentally clear.  A bit of drowsiness might creep in as the energy leaves, but it's not a total crash.  Recommended primarily as a daytime/early evening  med for energy, mood elevation, ocular issues, and its anti-nausea properties.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
Likely in the 65 day area

The look was simply spectacular, with wonderful structure, texture, solid harvest timing, and that pristine Sativa appearance. The smell matched that Sativa bent, and so did the experience, filling us with a focused energy after a bit of a sledgehammer start. Great for a late day pick-me-up, especially in situations where you need to maintain some semblance of functionality and mental clarity.

Chemdog x Super Silver Haze

This sample had some of our favorite type of structure, that wonderful Sativa that isn't fluffy or wispy but still has some space to breathe, letting the long pistils and calyxes all stand out clearly, even from a distance. A healthy light green with orange-brown pistils, and leaving trichomes all over your hands/grinder. 

This sample screamed Sativa to our staff with its blend of sharp citrus combined with hints of the chemical pine/cleaner aroma common in Haze varieties. One reviewer who grinds samples picked up a hint of a body odor funk after grind, which definitely recalled the ChemDawg parentage… otherwise, it seemed to be pure Haze smell-wise. It had a nicely pungent scent when handled but was not overpowering at all.

The first few hits were like flowery lemon soap with hints of the sharp chemical smell bite that was present in the smell. There was an interesting "cool" eucalyptus-like quality to the smoke and flavor that offset the sharp citrus notes well. 

A very potent start with welled-up eyes, forehead pressure, a buzzing feeling all around the skull, and a tingly feeling throughout the body… pure Haze feeling off the bat. The initial potency may be a little much for some patients, as it could trend towards the anxious side at times, especially at higher dosages. It was a 'stealth' med for half of our staff, but left the other half's eyes looking glazed-over and low, so it's a dice roll in professional situations. After the strong start, it backed off into a functional and driven energetic state that was moderately social and very clear-feeling throughout. There were some reports of drowsiness after the 2 hour mark, but it wasn't unanimous and might just depend on context/environment.

            (Trainwreck x Trinity) x Jack the Ripper
        
Bred by TGA/Subcool, the female used to breed Chernobyl was from a seed Subcool found in a sample of Trainwreck he got from a grower called Smokescreen.

This was the first experience with this strain for most of our crew, and it was thought to be an overall very pleasant experience, suitable for getting some work done or exercising a creative muscle. Its lasting effects with a long linger and very solid initial potency made up for the somewhat lacking taste and smell, which were just not particularly pungent or memorable. The minor grow flaws took this one down a notch, and we'd like to see it in perfect condition… but it was still very nice to look at and provided an easy, enjoyable experience.

Claw-shaped dingley green sepals arranged in open stacked calyxes, with bursts of copper pisitls, and average coverage by average-length, thin-stalked trichomes with small heads

This strain had a rather light smell that had a floral citrus quality to it, with some piney sharpness coming out after grinding. It was pleasant but not very pungent, a soft Sativa smell.

While one reviewer really liked the flavor of this sample, the majority of us felt it was simply average in the taste area, with a piney citrus flavor that wasn't remarkable. Though it wasn't pungent or overtly flavorful, it was a rather smooth smoke that didn't expand much, making it a good choice for patients who don't wish to cough.

Though it started off with a collection of head, eye, and chest pressure effects, we had some divergent opinions depending on which time of day we medicated. One reviewer who medicated early in the morning got a very potent-feeling package of cerebral effects that included some visual and auditory distortions. The other reviewers who medicated later in the day had more of a relaxing experience, with only a slight uptick in physical energy to start and a pervading mental energy that kept up throughout the experience. As it diminished entering 2 hours, a fairly typical "Sativa crash" had us feeling a bit groggy but still functional.

Bred by California wine country breeder, Saint George

This sample had an interesting red/purple cast to it overall, looking different than most samples from arm's length in the bag/jar and even more unique up close. The Purple Afghani influence can definitely be seen in the coloration, while the structure seemed much like many OG Kush varieties. Trichome coverage was above-average for sure, with quite a few golden and amber-capped trichome heads that were well-preserved. 

While not overtly pungent, the smell of this sample certainly did remind us a bit of cherries — actual cherries, not the uber-sweet candy conception of cherry. It had twinges of OG Kush acridness (some citrus, musk, and spice), but was overall pretty smooth-smelling and pleasant.

There was a faint fruity sweetness mixed in with some mentholated qualities and a bit of spice — overall though, it just had a hashy, smoky quality that wasn't particularly distinct or appealing. The flavor went downhill relatively quickly as well, only really showing itself on the first 2 hits.

This was a fairly typical hybrid experience overall, with a Sativa beginning and an even-handed Indica relaxation throughout. To start, it had our eyes feeling flush and full of pressure, some "headband"-like feelings, and a buzzing presence all over the body. Mentally, there were moments of stupor early on where thoughts were difficult to pull out of their hiding spots, but that seemed to clear up within the first hour, when the effects began their decline. This was a bit of a cerebral "thinker" strain, more prone to solitary thought or one-on-one social interaction rather than something like a party. It's not one for focus-heavy work due to its tendency for distraction, but it was relatively functional and clear-headed overall like most OG Kush hybrids. The comedown was a little bit on the tired side, as it seemed to turn into more of a base relaxation experience about 1.5 hours in.

Light green, burnt orange, and shades of brown. Maroon "cherry" colors come out when viewed from a distance and under shading.

Excellent, just like a cherry limeade with a faint pine undertone.

Sweet film only upon exhale. Not as strong as you'd hope after smelling.

A mild creeper, hitting medicinal levels at 3-4 minutes after smoking. It is a strong cerebral medicine typical of sativas, whereby my body was functioning very well (easily typing and manipulating the keyboard) but I couldn't write anything because my mind was not cooperating. Instead it followed its own thought track, eventually giving way to some indica traits.

            Unknown, perhaps a phenotype of Pure Kush
        
            This strain has a mysterious lineage but the consistency of this strain can tell a lot about Chinchilla. The aroma is a profound pine, chem terpene profile, stocked with pinene and limonene. Further, the structure of the buds gives away its heavy Afghan origin. The live trees grow to be sizable with several branches, much like an OG Kush plant, yet the perfume gives away that the Chinchilla retains much of its Afghan large-cola characteristics.
        
            An even coverage of trichome stalks that retain the trichome heads through dry, cure and shelf time, the chinchilla is very photogenic. The spiked calyxes swell with short pistils, orange in color. Depending on harvest time and grow conditions (i.e. temperature fluctuations) this strain can turn purple or pink.
        
            Chinchilla carries a juniper smell, not quite citrus, yet not quite deep conifer forest that many OG Kush strains have. Meeting somewhere in the middle, Chinchilla has a unique terpene profile and is quite robust in the garden all the way to the jar.
        
            Much like the unique aroma of Chinchilla, the flavor is one of a kind. The sweet juniper, almost mint flavor is detected easily, especially on freshly harvested and cured flowers. As the bud dries and shelf time is extended, musty skunk flavor is more dominant, blending in with many OG Kush varietals.

Bred by THSeeds

Very frosty-looking in the hand and up-close, this Chocolate Chunk had sound structure, with spear-shaped nugs of a healthy green hue, with sparse medium orange pistils.

This sample was slightly musky in the jar, but yielded a light and slightly sweet herby smell once ground. Pleasant enough, just not pungent or particularly distinct.

It tasted of slightly sweet and floral hash — one reviewer picked up on a creaminess that did bring to mind the strain's name. Again, not particularly pungent or distinct, but the smoke was smooth and easy to consume.

A numbing Indica feeling crept up on us, gaining in strength over the initial 30 minutes until a pervading warmth and calmness overtook the head and chest area. A bit quiet and reserved initially, it had us feeling extremely mild-mannered and calm, sitting quietly and enjoying the feeling. Once the wave of potency died off around 1:15 into it, it released its hold a bit and we were more social and active, with occasionaly moment of mental haze. We think this would be a good movie Indica or good for sitting around a campfire — aware enough to get sucked into something, but heavily relaxing.

            Hybrid
        
A squat-growing sativa that has almost pure Haze qualities, Cinderella 99 is truly a gem of cannabis engineering.  It produces a long, thick central colas if left up-topped and has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making it extremely desirable to breeders.  A very good producer as well, it's equally suitable for commercial or connoisseur gardens.  It's been used in countless crosses over the years, and though the original seed stock is thought to be largely extinct, many breeders have created very stable F2 seed stock, allowing this incredible plant's genetic line to live on.

'Princess' clone (Sensi Seeds Jack Herer F2) x (Jack Herer x Shiva Skunk), 'cubed' by back-crossing over 3 generations









'Princess' was a specially-selected Sensi Jack Herer F2 from the late 90's… a male seed from the same batch of Jack Herer was crossed to a special Shiva Skunk female, producing some male seeds suitable for breeding.  A selected male was crossed with Princess, the product seeds of which were then crossed back to Princess over three generations.  Ideally, Princess was 'cubed' by being bred to her male offspring, producing an extremely stable seed stock that become the legendary Cinderella 99.

Varies a bit according to phenotype (there are two main ones — grapefruit and pineapple), but it's generally a sharp and almost putrid citrus/pineapple.  The Brothers Grimm's favorite phenotype was known as the "evil pineapple" pheno and has an almost rotten meat quality to the sharp fruity smells. 

Much like the smell, it seems Haze dominant, with acrid citrus notes as well as some flowery touches.  The flavor depends upon phenotype, with the famous "evil pineapple" pheno having a complex rotten fruit flavor with floral hints, and the "grapefruit" phenotype is similar to New York City Diesel in flavor profile, with a sharp and musky citrus flavor. 

Cinderella 99 is known for having a soaring cerebral effect that can be very rushy for some patients.  It's often a "thinker" strain, making the mind race at a million miles per hour and even causing visual and auditory distortions.  Recommended most highly for its strong nerve effects, headache relief, appetite stimulation, and energy.  Not really recommended for those with anxiety issues or those seeking sleep aid or deep relaxation… this is a strain which can keep you awake at night due to the uptick in mental activity. 

Bred for indoor growing, C-99 works well in soil or hydro, but the best flavors are generally realized through soil.  It's a plant that stays relatively short for its sativa-heavy lineage, producing a lot of branches and a long main cola if left untrained.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
Very short for such a heavy sativa, it can reach maturity as early as 45 days after onset of 12/12, with some late ones finishing around 60.

A great introduction to a Cindarella 99 for people who can't handle the super rushy feelings it can sometimes give, this hybrid has a little bit of something for everyone. The absolutely beautiful trich-laden appearance hinted at the potency that lay in wait, but not the complex interactions of Indica and Sativa going on at all times. The strangely focused and quick movement paired with the calmed and warm body was pretty unique and thoroughly enjoyable. This was a perfectly-grown sample that holds a ton of potential — if the taste can get dialed in a bit better, it will really be something.

Cinderella 99 x Black Domina

Absolutely loaded with trichomes (especially the leaf surfaces, which looked white), this sample was an attractive medium strong green with standard orange pistils. It was a rather dense yet slender nug, and it had a little bit of give to it when squeezed rather than breaking apart. 

Musky almost rotten fruit smell in the jar, but it changes a bit after the grind to a clearly pineapple-tinged scent, but one that was lacking the normal 'bite' that is associated with a Cinderella 99… in all though, very appealing and rather pungent.

An ethereal pineapple sweetness hangs at the back of the throat, but other than that, it's mostly just hashy-tasting and not particularly pungent. Though moderately expansive, it wasn't harsh at all, but burned to a mottled gray and black ash, indicating it might've benefited from a more thorough flush.

A very direct and focused energy to start, with quick, precise movement and a strong mind-body connection — there was a tendency to feel almost jittery, but that subsided after the first 15 minutes or so. The divergent hybrid nature of this strain was felt immediately, with potent head effects and that lovely warm radiating Afghani body feeling paired throughout the experience. A calm energy with a strong eye presence was the enduring effect of this strain — the Black Domina seems to really calm down the C-99 and keeps the edge off of it that makes many people nervous about C-99. That influence grew stronger as it went on, making this one a bit of an up-then-down experience.

We were excited to try this strain, as none of us had ever gotten the chance… it's a piece of cannabis history and formed a key component of the original Sam the Skunkman Skunk #1, which has made its way into countless hybrids over the last 20+ years. Needless to say, we really enjoyed this strain in the "bag appeal" areas, but it really shined with its mix of strongly Sativa yet functional effects package that had us feeling motivated, social, and focused. A superb choice as a daytime medication for those who need to be on-point mentally, it packs enough power for veterans at higher dosages, but won't totally overwhelm a newer patient either.

Landrace Colombian

Classic landrace Colombian strain from the Santa Marta mountain range, released in seed form by World of Seeds Bank

The Sativa was evident in its overall light structure, with many super-frosty guard leaves shielding long teardrop calyxes and light camel-colored pistils. Classic look to this one, we really loved the trichome coverage and the overall texture, which was easy to handle and prepare. Some might complain about the lack of density, but this is fine by us, especially in an equatorial Sativa.

A blend of slightly musky yet fresh citrus (lemons and limes mainly) with a skunky quality, this strain could well be the template for what many modern Sativa hybrids smell like… it reminded us of so many other strains, most notably Durban Poison (another landrace Sativa). The aroma was nicely pungent both in and out of the jar, but really freshened up and got a lovely tangy quality when ground up.

Very interesting tea tree/citronella oil taste, slightly floral and creamy… there was also the lemon/lime tang from the aroma that came through at times. It was a complex and engaging taste, but we really enjoyed how smooth the smoke was… only one reviewer coughed at all, and the expansion was totally manageable.

Strongly Sativa to start (like many strains), it hit the eyes and forehead strongly, producing a buzzing feeling and some pressure fluctuations. Alert and active, this sample left us feeling strongly medicated yet totally functional and positive mentally — heads were upright and dialed-in to whatever activity was happening at the moment. Cerebral but not overly racy or frantic at all, this would likely make a good at-work type of strain due to its mental clarity. There was a solid muscle relaxation component that came along with it though, making this a good choice for those who require some relaxation and pain relief with their Sativa strains. Stable and smooth, this one faded out cleanly and left us feeling great.

This unreleased cross from DNA Genetics is a Colorado-grown original, and you won't find it anywhere else. The initial burst of giggle-inducing potency keeps the mood high throughout the duration while the Afghani influence is clearly felt though warm, pulsing body waves and overall relaxation. The smell is truly something else — a very unique scent that reminded us of a Durban at times — though we really wish it translated more directly into the taste.

LA Confidential [OG LA Affie x Afghani] x Sour Cream [Original Sour Diesel x G-13 Haze]

A limited release cross by DNA Genetics available in seed for a short time in Colorado.

Verdant dark green with lots of slender creamy orange pistils, this #1 phenotype has an interesting stout yet not particularly dense structure, and above-average trichome coverage. 

This strain has a truly unique biting yet sweet eucalyptus that attacks immediately when ground up.  In the jar it reminded us of a creamy lime soda or even a gin and tonic, with a definite spiciness that hinted at the G-13 Haze lineage.

A rather odd and cool mentholated smoke, this strain wasn't quite as pleasing in this area as it was in the aroma category.  It tickled the throat a bit despite the cool feeling, but produced a sweet-smelling smoke that perfumed the room.  There was a hint of the citrus sweetness, but the menthol sensation overrode it for the most part.

Immediately potent, this strain is a big time mood elevator and had us laughing at ourselves a bit as we struggled to get a grip on the first 25 minutes of the experience.  A heavy feeling in the back of the head as well as a warm, pulsing body spoke to the Indica side of this cross, while a strong presence behind the eyes and the giggly mental state were the Sativa contributions to this balanced experience.  While it got a bit heavier and tired as it wore on, it finished cleanly, returning us to a calmed yet aware state.

            Known to be a bit of a 'creeper', it takes a few minutes to kick in — but once it does, it's a Sativa-dom head slam that will leave you staring at the wall in no time.  Coming along with the Hazy mental state is a buzzing but relaxed body that eases many daily aches and pains.  As it progresses, it takes on more of an Indica profile, with a strong couchlock tendency and a mental state that can easily lead into sleep.  It's a long-laster as well, always approaching or passing the 3 hour mark.  Recommended for moderate to high-level patients who desire a relaxing Sativa with a rather strong body component. 

            Responds well to training (LST and super-cropping) and topping, grows fairly tall and branchy and finishes with generous yields when properly grown.

Absolutely a great hybrid and one of the best aromas available today. The flavorful taste of the Cotton Candy (or Sweet Tooth) mixed with the great power of Romulan, makes this an ideal medication. An important note to make is that there seems to be no peak of high with this strain, so although the duration could have been better to receive an A, a patient can easily up the dosage to reach desired effects.

Romulan x Cotton Candy

Bred by Federation Seeds

Nice fluffy flowers with tons of pinkish hairs emerging from the calyxes. Very nice trichome count.

The smell is very fragrant. Very sweet like cotton candy (a blue candy smell), with a very pungent skunk odor.

Sweet taste of fruity candy. Its thick skunky odor stays in the back of the throat. A nice taste but not very strong compared to the frangrance or other sweet tasting strains.

The medicine kicks in real quick and hits the head and body - rising effects for 15 minutes. Gives a wavy feeling across the body, with a strong cerebral high. Makes you very energetic in the mind, but often shuts down the body at the same time.

The lineage of Cougar Piss is SoCal Cat Piss crossed with an Afghani IBL (inbred line), making it an indica-dominant hybrid. This temperamental Cat Piss cross is made more stable and vigorous by breeding it with an Afghani line.

SoCal Catpiss x Afghani #1 IBL

Cougar Piss is a Colorado-bred strain coming out of Rare Dankness Seeds. The seed line was released over Cannabis Cup weekend and all packs have been purchased and are available for sale in Colorado only. 

The potent and very unique NorCal Catpiss aroma and flavor come through strongly here.  Contrary to popular belief, Catpiss (and this Cougar Piss, which takes most strongly after its mother) actually doesn't smell like ammonia, but has a strangely sharp yet fresh bite that has undertones of sour mango and only carries a hint of its namesake. 

The initial taste is much the same as the smell, but the lingering flavor on the palate is actually that of, well, cat urine.  As unpleasant as that may sound, it's a strangely addictive flavor that people who have tried the original Catpiss will remember fondly and pick up immediately in this cross.

This is a very potent strain, immediately serving to cast a dulling "sensory blanket" over the head and eyes, and making the user feel positive and relaxed, bordering on goofy.  The initial effects are very strong but never anxious or uncomfortable, making it acceptable for those who sometimes struggle with anxiety during the onset of potent strains.  Mental function tends to slow down quite a bit with this strain, and the Afghani lends a strong body heaviness that will tend to keep the user mostly sitting or otherwise relaxing.

            Cough x Fire OG x Loompas Headband
        
            This hybrid strain pulls together the best of many relms of cannabis. From the Loompas Headband (an indica phenotype) the Cough Fire Headband gets amazing pine, citrus lemon flavor. From Fire OG, the strain picks up trademark bud structure of OG Kush, and from the Cough, the bud produces a thick, flavorful smoke that many people enjoy in quality hand raised cannabis.
        
            Because of the heavy lineage of Headband and Fire OG, dried flowers have low density, and rather contain swollen calyxes that spiral up axial branches. The flowers grow on several branches, typical of many Headband varietals. Dried buds are light green with few hairs, or pistils.
        
            Pine, citrus and skunk. This strain is a combination of many aromatic strains in the Kush family of cannabis.
        
            The flavor of Cough Fire Headband is extraordinary in that it concentrates the heavy OG and Headband lineage. The result is a heavy skunk, pine flavor that can be experienced on every last hit.

Beautiful. In plain sight it appears extremely white/light yellow. These pictures show that there really is a good amount of orange hair throughout. This strain will become very noticeable as it progresses and I have a feeling some folks will believe they are dealing with a "white" strain.

A nice, strong aroma. While it was familiar I was unable to pick out the individual characteristics of the crosses, confirming this really is its own strain and positioned to grow.

The taste got me as an earthy piney taste when I was expecting a more fruity experience. Excellent expansion.

Energy based Sativa buzz. Very easy to work and stay motivated, not so easy to watch a movie or relax.

When we got this sample, Dr. Blaze informed us that this was the first real batch ready for the public and that it will be receiving lots of attention and improvements over the coming months. That jives with our experience for sure, as it appeared that this one just didn't quite reach the genetic potential it holds. The Coup mother was one of the nicest in-house creations we've come across, and with the Widow potency, we were expecting a little more of a slam/couchlock experience. But it remained mostly heady (though having GREAT anti-anxiety and solid body relaxation properties), leaving us functional though a little dull-feeling… can't wait to see this one in its completely dialed-in form.

Coup de Grace x White Widow Max

Bred by A20 Labs in Colorado

Not outwardly as frosty-looking and tight as the sample we received from its mother plant (the Coup de Grace), this one was a little loose in structure, but it made for a pretty striking appearance and left the hands sticky after handling. Dark army greens overall blended with thick ropey orange pistils — the tall, just-on-the-verge-of-ambered trichomes weren't that apparent until under the scope.

This sample carried strong notes of peaches and blueberries along with a little of the saccharine sweet you find in Bubblegum strains. An interesting almost liquor-like menthol sweet bite was present as well, with above-average pungency overall.

While it was difficult to pick up (one review reported no taste), we were able to notice a floral and ethereal berry sweetness with hints of smokey almost tequila-like flavor. Perhaps due to the tiny seeds, the taste went downhill quickly after the first 2 hits

A warm body and a nearly spinning head started us off with this one, a nice sting of potency right at the beginning that was felt mainly in the head and eyes, which filled up with mild pressure and lasted almost the entire first hour. After that hour had passed, it retreated to a fairly neutral yet relaxed state where mood wasn't necessarily enhanced but not soured either. Mentally relaxed an pain-free, but a little slow and dull-feeling, the latter part of the med did feel more on the Indica side, which we had been waiting for based on the White Widow Max father.

Despite the long duration, this one didn't stay at peak potency for very long, only feeling strong for 45 minutes or so , then feeling eminently functional and basically scaling down from there until it was barely noticeable at about two and a half hours. That said, the effects were great for all of us and made this a pretty perfect daytime medication no matter the activity… it would be good for creative pursuits, data entry/menial type of work, watching a movie, etc. — anything where sustained attention is desirable would be enhanced by this one. Taste and smell-wise, it pretty much brought the expected Jack Herer bag of smells and tastes, though the smell in particular was top-notch and would be the deciding factor to make us give this strain a try amongst 20 others. This is recommended as a fairly motivational and focused daytime type of med for those who don't need serious pain relief or enduring top-level potency.

Bred by DinaFem Seeds

Though this sample probably wouldn't stand out in a row of jars full of top shelf strains, it certainly belongs there judging from its coating of well-preserved trichomes and overall healthy appearance.

This strain smelled like almost every other top-notch Jack Herer or Jack hybrid (including Jack Flash) and definitely ranked among the top examples we've had in that vein — super fresh and "cool" lemon-pine cleaner smell with a wonderful backing floral sweetness that seemed to come out more post-grind. The post-grind smell reminded one reviewer of grenadine — very nice. It wasn't super-pungent mostly due to its Haze nature, but did majorly increase in pungency when ground-up.

Not quite as "Jack-y" as the smell, the flavor was a little more muted, with some slightly earthy notes at times overpowering the spicy, flowery Haze flavor. The smoke was very smooth and non-expansive, making this a superb choice for patients who don't want to cough when medicating. It burned away to a light gray ash, showing that it had received a proper flush before harvest.

This was a very cerebral Sativa, leaving one reviewer staring blankly at the TV for 15 minute stretches and the others feeling rather energetic and motivated by their tasks. The "staring blankly" review wasn't due to couchlock or mental sedation, but rather due to the way this strain causes your attention to dial into whatever happens to interest you at the time, an almost unwavering focus. Physically, the strain started with the hallmark Sativa effects such as orbital/eye/head pressure, a slightly buzzing body, and an uptick in both mood and heart rate. There wasn't much of a direct body effect, but we all felt capable and pain-free throughout the experience, able and willing to take on almost any task while also looking the part (very 'stealth' med — no outward physical effects).

We always have a place for moderately potent Indica strains in our lives, and this strain fit that bill perfectly, signaling its Afghani roots in smell, flavor, and effect. Though not overtly potent except right at the beginning, this strain had good "torque" and kept up at a fairly high level, declining smoothly over the 2nd half of the duration and leaving behind a relaxed and capable mind. It didn't help with severe pain, but it did really make our bodies feel good, and we like this strain mostly as an evening relaxer for days when a little mental uplift and a few hours on the couch leading into sleep is the perfect recipe.

Afghani x Skunk #1 (originally from Mr. Nice Seeds, their version of Sensi's Big Bud)

Bred by Mr. Nice Seedbank









Thin claw-shaped wasabi green sepals with armadillo accents arranged in open spiral calyxes, snaked with shocks of ochre pisitls, and above average coverage by short, thick-stalked trichomes with large heads

Slightly earthy, musky, and lightly citrusy smell which limited pungency, even after grinding

A base piney, earthy type of profile that was somewhat pungent, but didn't really taste like anything specific of noteworthy. It wasn't just the taste of smoke itself, but was not too far from that point — the Afghani seems to have taken charge in the flavor department for sure, as there was no Dutch Skunk sweetness in it at all. 

This medicine came on fairly strong to start, hitting behind the eyes and giving a somewhat heavy feeling (like being pulled downwards) throughout the body. An uptick in head pressure and a vibrating/buzzing feeling around the scalp and face made for a relaxing experience, as did the buzzing body. The reviewer who had the largest dosage felt a bit more mentally-stilted than the others, staying in that slightly spacey, stare-at-nothing type of state for much of the first hour. The others reported a less heavy feeling during this period, one that left them able to function if needed, and overall elevating the mood and making for a placid, smiley mood overall. Regardless, the main feelings began to decline around 1 hour, leaving behind either a smooth relaxation, or a deep one, largely depending upon dosage. One reviewer who did the review late fell asleep at the 1.5 hour mark, earlier than normal for him, and awoke feeling wonderful, so we believe there are some sleep aid properties to this one for sure.

The appearance of this strain is probably what most people would talk about if forced to choose, as it is truly impressive and beautiful, possessing both great structure as well as trichome coverage. Though we wanted the taste to match the lovely smell, it was adequate and didn't harm the experience in the least — the smoke was very smooth and enjoyable. The area where this strain really shined though was in its initial potency and its long-lasting duration, both of which were top-notch. In previous experience with the Northern Lights used in this cross, that was true of that strain as well — very enduring med that stays at medicinal levels longer than most. The particular brand of functional Indica relief this strain offered will help almost anyone dealing with daily pains and stresses while leaving them able to live their lives capably and handle social and professional situations. This new cross is great for intermediate users but will even impress the connoisseurs with its appearance and staying power.

This is a seriously pretty sample, with its tight but not blocks structure, healthy light green coloration, and it's frankly ridiculous coating of trichomes. The working title for this strain, "Crystal Gayle" is certainly appropriate, as it shimmers with globe-headed mostly clear trichomes, looking as if it was sprayed with glitter.

This strain had a nicely sharp and pungent (both pre and post-grind) citrus cleaner quality to it, even dabbling in the familiar Diesel range at times. It also had some hints of soil (probably the Northern Lights influence) and pine as well, making it a well-rounded spectrum of pleasing aromas.

This strain had a middling taste — it certainly wasn't bad, but it just didn't grab us in the way we were expecting after the aroma. It had many of the same elements, they just weren't as strong or noticeable — it was a slightly sweet piney Haze type of flavor with hints of the cleaner sharpness.

It mostly seemed to hit the head to start, giving us a buzzing feeling around the crown of the head, a slight increase in eye/brow pressure, some ear ringing, and a bit of a light head. Almost before we noticed, this strain seemed to lift us up off the couch and into a slew of activities requiring a moderate amount of focus — it had moments of slight raciness, but was overall very comfortable. It seemed to be a bit of a "creeper", building in effect through 30 minutes, when it had a full compliment of effects including strongly burning eyes. Almost trance-like at times, it had us feeling functional despite being very medicated and relaxed… it managed to retain mental clarity throughout the duration. It didn't seem to do a ton for muscle tension despite the high levels of mental relaxation, but showed great promise with appetite stimulation. A smooth descent where potency cycled on and off in waves finished things off, leaving us feeling aware and peppy by the end.

Bred in-house by The Health Depot

The sample was covered in a thick carpet of trichomes, and was a pleasing and fairly vibrant collection of greens with orange pistils, structured like many well-grown Sativas; light, but not wispy. 

The cross of the two parent strains was in full effect here — the Sour Diesel influence was especially evident, as that was the dominant note (fuel, chemical, gun oil)… But very present along with those pungent smells was a fruity, citrus-leaning sweetness with a certain putrid quality to it, much like an overripe pineapple. This was a very pungent and unique sample…

While one reviewer got a reasonably strong and very enjoyable taste from this strain, the majority of the crew struggled to get a read on it and weren't that impressed by what they did get. A fleeting, perfume-like sweetness was all the majority reported, but the one who liked it picked up on a floral-leaning citrus sweetness that faded out after about 2 hits, followed by a fuel-tinged aftertaste. 

This was the area that this strain really shined, providing a near-immediate package of potent effects that got on top of a few of our staff members, surprising them a little bit. Very intense head and eye pressure fluctuations combined with almost mind-numbing potency had us sitting and trying to get our bearings for the first 15 minutes or so. A fairly strong body presence developed during that time as well, with a wave of relaxation and body waves washing over us and making the near-psychedelic effects a little easier to handle. Once the initial burst left us, it calmed down into a relaxed state that still had us feeling some of the head pressure and eye presence into the 3rd hour. This was a very enduring med that kept up medicinal-level effects almost into the 2nd hour.

            Sativa Dominant Hybrid
        
Coming out of the breeding projects of a grower known as "High & Lonesome", with the blessings of Top Dawg Seeds (the holders of Tres Dawg), this hybrid combines the legendary Purple Urkle clone with JJ-NYC's fiercely potent Tres Dawg, which is essentially a Chem D backcross.  The Urkle imparts its signature coloration and some of its aroma and flavor, but the added sharp chemical kick of the Chem D makes everything more interesting than a standard "purple" and make this variety one of the strongest-smelling strains in almost any garden.  Also increased is the potency of the Urkle, making it much more sedative and hard-hitting cerebrally — this strain is best used in the evenings, as it can lead to sleep due to the deep relaxation and strong ocular effects is offers.

Purple Urkle x Tres Dawg (Chem D x [Chem D x Afghani])

Bred by "High & Lonesome" (aka H&L), this strain is fairly new (circa 2009) and though it originated on the East Coast, it is quickly gaining a reputation for its potency and incredible smell through the medical marijuana dispensaries of Colorado and California.  The strain is named after a David Grisman song of the same name.  The so-called "Poodle Nuts" cut is the most prized and was selected and spread by a grower known as "forty".

Dark leaves and purple petioles lend an undoubtedly Indica appearance to the plant overall, and it will often finish completely purple depending upon nutrient regime and temperature.  Most often the finished buds are a robust medium green with bright orange pistils, with mottled purple tinges appearing commonly on the top nugs moreso than the lower buds.  Large, fat calyxes bristle with tall, medium-headed trichomes which pack the surface with a density in the upper echelon of strains.  The buds are most similar to Urkle buds in overall appearance, round and swelled-up with a moderate amount of leaves mixed in.

One of the most pungent strains we've ever encountered, the very complex interplay of the Urkle's grape-spice musk and the Tres Dawg's hair-curling Chem-skunk funk will impress anyone who likes an aggressive aroma.  The plant when growing will stink more than 95% of strains and that translates to the final product as well — buds left untouched will exhibit a more soft Purple-tinged aroma, but as soon as they're broken apart, it's deep ChemDawg acridness and skunk-fuel all the way.

Falling just shy of the aroma in terms of overall pungency, the Waltz's flavor matches the qualities of the smell perfectly, offering the same blend of fruity-spicy Purple sweetness and overwhelming Chemmy funk.

If raw potency is what you desire, the Waltz will certainly scratch that itch, hitting hard immediately and not letting up for a solid 2 to 3 hours, even catching veteran users by surprise with its complete package of effects.  An immediate burst of warmth and pressure in the eyes and a fiercely vibrating body effect blends perfectly and helps the user relax but also fills them with a strange cerebral energy which is conducive to sedentary activities and projects as well as socialization.  The initial 30 minutes to 1 hour period of effects feel like a true hybrid, with just enough Sativa influence to keep the mind active and the mood high — however, the Indica side of things normally takes over past that point, making the mental state more pensive and relaxed and continuing the loose, massaged feeling throughout the body.

Though it produces a moderate-to-large yield of rock-hard and large-calyxed buds, the Waltz also produces quite a lot of fan leaves, and fairly aggressive defoliation is suggested in order to maximize yield of lower bud sites.  The plant is a fairly heavy feeder, often requiring additional Cal-Mag through early flower.  It grows rather stout and bushy, with only a small stretch during flowering, mostly fattening up rather than growing upwards.  Taking it on the early side of the harvest window normally results in the best flavor and a more cerebral effect, while allowing some amber trichomes to develop puts this strain squarely on the Indica side of things effects-wise and seems to take some of the sweetness out of the flavor.

A real treat for Diesel-lovers and those seeking a balanced overall experience, this Death Star really did bring the best of both its parent strains. Early Diesel effects subsided into an ultra-relaxing and sedative Indica that carried a variety of medical benefits. The grow quality was top-notch, with no real flaws and a pleasing appearance, smell, and taste. The potency is rather high overall and it lasted a long time, so we'd recommend this mostly to moderate to experienced patients who like an acrid taste spectrum and an up-then-down experience.

Maybe the highlight of this strain, the aroma was very pungent, both pre and post-grind. The sour fuel stank carried notes of rubber, menthol, and lemon but also had a strange sweetness lingering in the background. The combination of those smells made this one really noteworthy and impressive to our staff — great choice for Diesel-lovers.

Very much like the smell, the taste was a slight sweet Diesel-dominant flavor with hints of citrus and soil and hash. The sweetness was elusive and seemed to come and go, but when the whole package was present, it was top-notch. 

A building pressure in the eyes and around the back of the head and temples started things off, with an increase in heart rate and some perspiration happening at times. The body started buzzing early on and that kept up throughout the experience, though it turned to more of a warming feeling as it went on. The Indica side of this cross showed up almost out of nowhere, with a couchlocked yet mentally clear and social effect coupled with the warm and relaxed body. This one seemed to depend on mood and time of day a bit, as a large dosage in the evening sent one reviewer to bed unexpectedly, but most daytime reviews were very relaxed but not narcotic or sleep-inducing.

Very pretty and scoring well in all the bag appeal areas, this strain was totally new to us and provided a balanced Sativa experience that left us feeling positive and fairly functional throughout. Its calming influence went a long way in reducing daily stresses and pains while keeping us fully engaged in the world. The body relaxation likely came from the relatively high CBD ratio for a strain not intended to be a CBD-rich varietal, which was among the highest we've seen — that factor made this strain really feel like a worthwhile hybrid… it's more than just a Sativa. We recommend this to almost any level of patient who seeks mental ease and a positive mood shift while still getting some Indica qualities in the body.

A blend of frosty greens with bright orange pistils, this sample was pretty textbook-looking, but we mean that in the best way possible. Super frosty in spots , the nugs were moderately dense and easy to handle. 

Piney sour citrus, like a fresh grapefruit with a backdrop of skunk and a sweetness that seemed to be overwhelmed by the other smells. Relatively pungent, it pretty much retained its same smell in the jar as when it was ground. Seems to be NYCD-dominant, though lacking the actual Diesel smell.

Much like the smell, it was citrus-pine at the front, but the taste had a slightly more acrid quality, edging more towards the "pine cleaner" end of the spectrum and losing the subtle sweetness that was present in the smell — rather pungent-tasting overall.

Hitting the eyes pretty quickly this strain had us feeling immediately a bit spaced-out and sent our vision into a slight tunnel while also creating a buzzing body energy throughout our limbs and torso. The fairly potent start receded somewhat quickly to a more relaxed state where we felt creative and positive, seeking the company of others and only occasionally fumbling around in conversation. The mood elevation was even and constant throughout the experience — one reviewer noticed quite a lot of muscle relaxation later in the duration, where yawning and stretching felt amazing. Clean finish back to a sober state without much of a drained feeling.

Like all of his breeding projects, DJ Short's Flo began with the duo of Thai parents (Flo is Purple Thai-dominant), beefed up and normalized by an Afghani.  There are two main phenotypes for Flo, one that is totally light green ("the Green pheno") and another that has lots of blue shades in it ("the Blue pheno").  Though the plant is Sativa-dominant, the Afghan cut down on the flowering time and overall height to make it very suitable for indoor growth.  The most prized Flo variation is often referred to as the "Temple Flo" cut and smells like exquisite Nepalese temple hash.

Highland Thai, Purple Thai (landrace Chocolate Thai x landrace Oaxacan Gold), and Afghani (one generation-removed landrace from the Pacific Northwest) — these are the basis of nearly all of DJ Short's breeding projects and the Flo is heavy on the Purple Thai and Afghani.









See this link for the backstory on several of DJ Short's strains, including Flo.

Very distinctive blend of sweet hash, menthol, expensive soil, anise, and some slight fruitiness — Flo's aroma is almost completely distinct and could easily be picked out of a lineup by most experienced users.  It's also known for scenting the room with an almost incense-like smoke once consumed.

Much like the smell, it has a cool, creamy mentholated tone to it, with strong soil, menthol, and hash flavors blending into an interestingly harmonious whole. 

A hybrid in the truest sense, Flo seems to simultaneously be a Sativa and an Indica rather than taking turns, as many strains do.  Relaxing, uplifting, and mentally clear, Flo's effects package are perfect for those looking for some body relief and relaxation but still need to retain functionality.  It's never a super-potent strain to the point of being overwhelming — it's a very even and smooth experience overall that is highly recommended for all levels of patient, primarily as a daytime med. 

Works well indoors or outdoors in a variety of mediums.  She is a finicky feeder like many of DJ Short's strains and generally likes light nutrient schedules until flowering is really going, when a slight increase is tolerated.  The multi-harvest ability of Flo generally takes 10-14 days to produce the second batch of buds after pruning off the initial ones.  Flo is a medium-sized plant overall and is branchy, making it a good choice for SCROG but not a good choice for SOG applications.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
55- 62 days

This rare Diesel-Chem hybrid lives up to its lineage with a hair-curling aroma and an effect which nearly matches the smell in potency. Though it is a sativa-dominant variety, it has the tendency at higher dosages to live up to its strain name, giving the user an extremely relaxed, almost narcotic feeling to go along with all the cerebral effects the Diesel and Chem family are known for.
As Dopium’s high whittles away, the effect becomes more narcotic and relaxing, giving a bit of the classic sativa "crash" which can send a previously excitable user to bed by the second hour. The "up then down" style of the experience can be mitigated by a smaller dosage, repeated over shorter duration — this will keep the "up" side rolling and stave off the sleepy side of the effects. Overall, Dopium is something we'd call an early evening strain, great for some socializing and fun before a relaxing finish. It aids with energy, appetite, and mood early on, then muscle relaxation, anti-anxiety, and sleep aid properties complete the experience.

Chem's Sister x Sour Diesel

Found by a grower named "ToneDawg", this strain is simply a stellar bagseed.  The cut was passed onto one of the owners at Denver Relief, and it's since become one of their signature varieties.  As far as we're aware, this particular cut is not available for sale in any other dispensary… at least not under this same strain name.

Lots of bracts vs. leaf coverage on this one, and it has the very dark green leaves and signature pink salmon-colored stigmas of the Sour Diesel side of the lineage, while also occasionally purpling up on the fringes by finish like the Chem's Sister.  The plant gets somewhat tall but will produce a solid yield when let finish through 70 days.  The trichome coverage of this variety again mirrors the parents — it's one of the frostier plants you'll come across in dried nug form.  Most nugs tend to have a fairly loose structure, similar to the Sour Diesel, with tiny dark leaves interspersed with stacking bracts which look almost grey due to the density of trichomes.

The complex and pungent bouquet the Dopium offers is certainly Diesel-dominant, with that sharp chemical-fuel-rubber element which so many connoisseurs seek out taking the forefront and practically assaulting the senses.  However, there are some interesting floral and spice notes present which differentiate this cut from other Chem-Diesel hybrids and seem to influence the flavor as well.

Less outright acrid than the aroma, the flavor still has strong notes of chemical pine and hickory smoke.  The floral side of things lingers in the aftertaste makes it more palatable for those patients who love Diesel type effects but cannot handle the "Chem breath" flavor it often leaves behind… this is a lower key, more measured Chem-Diesel experience.  The smoke is rather expansive without being harsh when well-grown.

Immediately heady and cerebral, it normally gives a burst of energy and mental activity early on, filling the user with a desire to laugh and talk.  At higher dosages, it can get a little spacey and cause occasional lapses in concentration, but the good mood and overall energy boost seems to mostly smooth over that aspect of things.  Along with the energy, there is a strong face and eye presence which at times gives the "headband" feeling of constriction.  The elevated state of being only lasts for about the first 45 minutes or so, when the timbre of the experience changes to a more sedentary, relaxing one as the strain shifts gears into its decline of effects.

Given the genetics, expect a stretch with this cut.  Like most varieties with wide internodal spacing, it's advisable to net or otherwise train the plants so they are not so lanky.

Though we missed the acrid Sour Diesel part of the equation at times, this was a very enjoyable Diesel experience that was neither too heavy nor too light. It felt like a true hybrid, with a blend of Sativa and Indica effects that played well together rather than battling for attention. The appearance was top-notch, with its sound but distinct structure, copious trichome coverage, and lack of flaws. The smell was right up our alley and seemed NYCD-dominant with a grapefuit bent.

            Sour Diesel x New York City Diesel
        
A Colorado clone variety

We all really liked the look of this one, from its foxtailed structure to its impressive trichome coverage. Just a very pretty example of a Diesel strain, with a strong lime green color, and peach pistils.

This one had some of the typical diesel notes in the jar/bag before it was ground up, but they seemed to disappear, turning into more of a sweet herby grapefruit… it seemed to be both sweet and musky at the same time, which is certainly unique. It seems that the NYCD dominated the smell department, not much of the acrid, pungent Sour Diesel smell at all… in this case, that wasn't a bad thing.

Similar to the smell but much less sweet-tinged, the taste was also a semi-musky citrus with some menthol qualities. It turned a bit more to the earthy/smoky side as it burned away, but overall was rather pleasant the whole way through. One reviewer reported some post-smoking throat burn, but the others felt it was a pretty smooth smoke despite being fairly thick. Pretty average taste overall, which was slightly disappointing after the top-notch aroma.

A typical diesel start, with pressure in the sinuses/cheeks/eyes, tickling/ringing in the ears, and a buzzing presence through out the body, at times feeling like butterflies in the stomach. It was never what we'd describe as 'rushy', but it was definitely heady and Sativa in nature to start. As the experience progressed, it seemed to take us to a middle-ground in a manner of ways — mood-wise, energy-wise, and mentally we seemed on an even keel. It had moments of sociability and laughter interspersed with moments of withdrawn silence and introversion. While feeling capable overall, there were also moments of short term memory loss and general slowness. As it faded out, there was some drowsiness, but nothing overwhelming that you can't shake off in the middle of the day.

This strain was so Indica in every way, with its super dense and blocky nug structure, its sweet scent, and its heavy couchlock-inducing effects. While it wasn't our favorite in terms of a daily use medication, it would be great for those days where you want to do nothing but sit around and relax, or days when pain or loss of appetite make life very difficult.

Claw-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stacked calyxes, striped with shocks of indochine brown pistils, and average coverage with thin, short-stalked bent trichomes with average heads

Very nice and super sweet Bubblegum smell, one of the most uncanny gum smells around. It turned a bit more fruity when ground and lost the saccharine sweetness.

Though it had traces of that strong sweetness and the actual gum flavor, this one tasted mostly like a bit of a "fruit punch", with a blend of fruity and sweet flavors and a flowery finish. The smoke was extremely thick and dense (like the nug) but also had a bit of unwanted harshness that burned the throat.

This Double Gum was an Indica-dominant experience for sure, with a heavy feeling behind the eyes and a hanging warmth over the body. Sitting gape-mouthed staring at something was not an uncommon effect, and the heavy almost wobbly head made sitting way more satisfying than moving around. It was functional enough but it was much nicer to sit on the couch and just enjoy it. Appetite stimulation was evident, and this was basically a typical Indica effects package thould be nice for an evening session.

            Indica-dominant hybrid
        
A landrace sativa variety from South Africa, Durban Poison is known for its spicy/sweet anise-like smell and taste and its clear-headed cerebral effect. Though it's a (normally) pure sativa, most versions finish fairly quickly and don't stretch like crazy. Many claim the real South African Durban Poison is very racy and finishes as long as 120 days, but that's not the case for the versions available in seed form (Afropips and African Seeds seems to be the longest to finish).
Per Sam the Skunkman, “South African Durban Poison was first introduced by me. I got maybe 100 seeds from South Africa and grew them in California in the late 70s. Most were hermaphrodite, small calyxes, as well as not so great buds. But I saw the potential for an early sativa so I worked with it for a few years to clean it up. I finally eliminated most of all the bad traits, and introduced it in the early 80s.”








“When I took it to Amsterdam it was an immediate hit, one of the few sativa strains that can be grown outdoors in Holland most years if the weather is okay at harvest time. Every seed merchant in Holland bought some and made copies as well as hybrids; all of the Durban Poison genetics being passed around were originally from my work until Afro-Seeds popped up a few years ago. My Durban Poison is sativa, pure IBL landrace created from seed lines, maintained with clones, male and female. There is no change in the gene pool now as any seeds are produced from selected clones 20 years old. The plants had a strong licorice/anise smell and taste, as well as being quite early in maturation. The strength was med-strong, vigor strong, yield quite good, very consistent. To be honest I considered it a daytime smoke.”

Durban is known for possessing a very distinct blend of sweet and spicy smells — fennel/anise, orange, lemon, and a creamy sweetness are the most common descriptors.

Very sweet and intoxicatingly complex, Durban Poison presents the sativa-lover with a palate of flavors ranging from sweet lemon candy to spicy anise, making it a favorite of many dispensary patients as well as connoisseurs.

Durban is a fabulous daytime strain, with a clear, functional effects package that stimulates creativity, sociability, and overall mood.  It's very energetic and is seen as one of the more pure-feeling sativa varieties widely available on the market. The true South African Durbans are known for being extremely racy and borderline psychedelic, but the toned-down Dutch versions that circulate the United States and Europe lose some of that edge, perhaps for the benefit of the average consumer.  The primary medicinal benefits are energy, appetite stimulation, migraine relief, and anti-nausea properties. 

Durban was known and loved in Holland because it was one of the few sativas that could finish outdoors — the short-flowering versions are suitable for Northern climates.  Grows very tall outdoors, but most varieties are totally manageable indoors, especially with training such as SCROG.

One of Colorado's underground favorites before becoming a staple in Boulder, CO, Dutch Treat Haze is one of the most wonderful Haze hybrids around, bringing the absolute best parts of Green House Seeds' famous Super Silver Haze but moderating the sativa effect with the uplifting yet still indica-dominant Amsterdam strain Dutch Treat. Both parent strains have a citrus element to them, and that comes out in this hybrid, but it also has interesting funky notes of eucalyptus, sandalwood, and floor cleaner.
The Super Silver Haze used in this cross is from old Dutch stock, as is the Dutch Treat. This strain shows what new breeding projects can do to reinvigorate what many consider as staid genetic lines, creating very exciting new hybrids.

Dutch Treat x Super Silver Haze

Prior to the establishment of HB 1284 which changed the dispensary scene in Colorado significantly in terms of supply chain, this strain was everywhere and in high demand because the creator was able to sell it to any dispensary who wanted it.  Once the legislation changed and centers had to grow at least 70% of their own cannabis, the creator ended up with Boulder Medical Marijuana Center and the strain has been an in-house favorite ever since, only occasionally being sold elsewhere.

Very light, almost minty green calyxes encase thin pink-red pistils and the nug shape overall is pointed, especially on the non-cola buds, which pop up in perfect little triangles on the stem almost at random.  The trichome coverage and structure is what we'd consider almost perfect, with moderate-sized heads of perfect rounded shape capping medium stems that cover the plant surface in a very even fashion.  The deep sparkle that the dried nugs possess make this an incredible "bag appeal" variety for a Sativa-lover.

The complex but undeniably Sativa aroma the Dutch Treat Haze offers blends the punchy, reedy side of the Haze family with the sweet, crisp citrus side (which is given an added boost by the sweet and also-citrusy Dutch Treat).  The perfect melding of Haze aromas in the flowers themselves also results in a wonderful floral-fresh-sweet-smelling smoke when it's combusted — in all, a treat for the nose.

Much like the smell, the flavor combines the sweet-citrusy Haze and Dutch Treat with the eucalyptus-funky Haze elements that often come out of good old-stock Super Silver Haze.  The flavor is especially noticeable and enjoyable in a joint, where the crisp flavor hangs on the lips all the way through to the crutch and lingers in the mouth and sinuses after smoking.

A near-immediate influx of pressure to the eyes and face area signal the arrival of this potent and torquey Sativa.  The internal buzzing and energetic-feeling waves that rush over the body can trend towards the racy and anxious side of things, but patients who don't struggle with nerve excitement or heart-based anxiety issues shouldn't have any issues.  Through the beating heart, the internal motivation fills the mind with racing thoughts and makes socializing at times difficult simply because the mind is so busy — however, experienced users and lovers of true Sativas will enjoy this more than see it as a possible detriment.  The final hour or so of the experience takes a decidedly Indica turn, partly from the "crash" that so often comes with powerful Sativas, but partly with the onset of the relaxing Dutch Treat presence.  This one is a great choice for appetite, mood elevation, and energy.

BMMC runs the DTH in both very large DWC setups as well as peat-based soil setups and has great success, so the plant can do well in any medium.  It seems to retain its natural flavor better than many strains when grown in hydro, so that may be the best choice for those looking for maximum trichome coverage, "bag appeal", yield, and flavor.  The plant itself grows tall and fairly branchy, making it suitable for SCROG moreso than SOG applications — training and a good veg period will reap major rewards yield-wise.

East Coast Alien in comprised of East Coast Sour Diesel and Alien Technology. East Coast Sour Diesel, also known as NYC Diesel -- The lore around Sour Diesel is immense-- is a vigorous sativa. Meanwhile, Alien Technology is an Afghan landrace indica. 

A balanced hybrid with growth traits of both an Old World Kush and Sour Diesel, a vigorous sativa in vegitative and flower stages of its growth. 

Finished buds are dense but with some fingers, as a result of the heavy diesel ancestry. Light green calyxes are encased in purple old world kush style leaves. 

Fuel and earth tones, rather complex.

The mood elevation was instant and lasting, but the potency was never all that high, and leveled off to a very mild state after about 1.5 hours, which is shorter than we'd like. However, the total duration including lingering eye effects was in the 3 hours area, so patients who medicate for ocular relief might find it more useful than others.

Bred in-house by Tree of Life Alternative Medicine in Colorado

A long, slender sample, this strain showed its Sativa dominance in its structure and average density. It was a pale green for the most part, but there were some extremely dark almost blue leaves visible.

his sample was a very subdued smell that consisted of fresh vegetation, pine, and a slight sweetness. 

We mostly got standard smoke notes (often called "hashy") along with more of the pine and slight sweetness that were present in the smell.

They could call this strain "mood elevation" — it really makes you smile to begin with and gives the urge to laugh at almost anything. Starting strong in the eyes and continuing that throughout the experience, this strain feels alternately light and heavy, fluctuating between a floaty head and a heavy body. Despite the sometimes heavy feeling, tasks (both mental and physical) were never an issue, making this a solid choice for retaining productivity while medicated. As it went on, it reduced itself down to a calm body and retained the mood elevation, making for a long lingering finish and a soft drop back to normalcy.

While we are not really fans of the smell and taste of this strain, the effects were enjoyed thoroughly by the staff. This strain provided a solid combination of mood uplift and strong body relaxation while keeping functionality mostly intact — this is a somewhat rare combination of effects that were perfect for fighting off the urge to get up when doing solitary work. The strange purple cast the trichomes had over the entire surface of the bud was also rather unique, especially when viewed with our microscope. If you're a patient that is looking for muscle and pain relief but don't want to be zombiefied and overtly sleepy, this is a very good choice.

Bred by Vancouver Island Seed Company

If you're a patient who likes big, blocky, dense structure this is the strain for you. Clearly Indica in structure, this strain has a large, conical bud shape with a collection of dark coloration, including an odd lavender cast to most of the trichomes (a few purple heads were spotted, but it was mostly the stems).

The smell of this one was typical hashy Indica with just a hint of sweetness that seemed to disappear as fast as it came. A hint of "garlic bud" type aroma stuck out at one reviewer as well — our opinion is that this is clearly an Afghani lineage plant based on the smell.

Much like the smell, this was a very generic and boring taste for us, simply tasting like hashy smoke for most of the duration. One reviewer did pick up hints of pine and a slight cherry-like sweetness, but it was fleeting. The flavor took a downturn mid-way through the session, bringing a bad, slightly bitter aftertaste to the party that we didn't enjoy at all. The final flush appeared near-perfect though, as the ash was a fluffy white… not sure where the iffy aftertaste came from.

This was a fairly unique med in that it felt strongly body-centric and Indica-heavy but seemed to leave the head nearly unaffected and functional. It started almost immediately, with a warming and relaxing body sensation creeping up from the legs through the torso and an overall relaxed mental state taking over. A heavy-headed feeling also came with the territory early on, definitely making us more comfortable on the couch than standing. Logical and social processes seemed uninhibited entirely by this strain, making it good for solitary, sedentary work — it relaxes the body enough to allow the mind to concentrate on the task at hand. If consumed later at night, the relaxation this strain provides will probably lead to sleep.

The pleasant and light OG Kush flavor and smell reminded us of the less aggressive branch of that family (Ghost and SFV), while the super-smooth smoking experience was enjoyed by all of the staff, even those who primarily vaporize.  Very potent and medicinal at first, it evolved into a more base relaxation experience after 1.5 hours or so, which led nicely into sleep when consumed at a late hour.  This is a very solid Kush experience… it both mentally clear and relaxing, while also possessing a stereotypical Kush flavor profile — suitable for either daytime or night time use, it provided solid relaxation without causing sluggishness.

Spearhead shaped sycamore green calyxes with dark kelp green accents, formed in tight nodal clusters, with dark copper pistils, and above average density of very short, thick-stalked trichomes with large heads

This sample had a light and spicy Kush scent, carrying a pronounced perfumey, floral hint along with the more standard Kush aromas.  When ground, it got slightly more aggressive and took on a light fuel/chem sharpness that added to the complexity.  This isn't the most pungent sample in the world, but you can smell it sitting in the jar from a good distance… it seems to settle a bit and dissipate quickly once ground though.

Very much like the smell, this was a spicy and soil-heavy OG, with a pleasant and non-aggressive Kush flavor.  The smoke was extremely smooth and not expansive, which made it a highly pleasurable smoking experience, especially for those with respiratory issues or patients who are used to vaporizing. 

This strain made us slightly light-headed and made our hearts race to start, serving to wake up the senses a bit and provide some internal energy that sustained at a high level through the first half of the effects.  A strong pulsing throughout the body (especially the legs and feet) along with moderate amounts of eye and temple pressure signaled the rather high potency of the early effects.  As it progressed, the talkative and social mood changed to a much more sedate one, where internal concentration on one thing at a time was high but sociability and multi-tasking ability was low.  As it left, we felt a little bit drained, but the body effects seemed to keep up at a relatively high level until the end.

One reviewer loved this strain and forgave its lack of blinding potency, but the other reviewers felt that it just wasn't potent enough to warrant an A-level grade. Visual appeal for this one was very high, with an array of beautiful colors and tons of sparkling trichomes that were harvested at the proper time. The smell and taste package were perfect for the strain lineage, and they seemed to match for the most part, which is always appreciated. The clean, heady, and energetic effects were perfect for any daytime use, and there were no physical signs of being medicated… good strain for professional situations. It just wasn't potent enough to get into the upper echelon, but it would be great for times when being strongly medicated isn't desired… this is definitely a great beginner smoke.

            Flo x Purple Kush
        
Bred by Karmaceuticals in Denver, Colorado

With no real flaws visible, a great array of coloration, and a thick layer of trichomes, this was a very stunning sample for our staff. The mix of dark green (almost black), lime green, orange/red pistils, and vibrant royal purple in spots made this a very interesting sample to look at.

This sample was a perfect marriage of the two parent strain smell-wise, with the floral and slightly sweet incense notes of the Purple Kush blending with the more herby and spicy Flo's fennel-kissed sweet hash aroma. This was among the cleanest-smelling strains we've had, absolutely floral and something we could smell all day, even though it wasn't all that pungent until it was broken into.

Almost matching the smell note-for-note, the taste was again a very clean and floral combination of the two parent strains. A little bit of the typical Purple "grape incense" type of flavor crept in, but it was balanced by the distinctive taste of Flo. While it wasn't the most pungent-tasting sample around, the taste stayed at a high level until the end, never getting that "cashed" taste or displaying any real harshness. This was a smooth and easy smoke, highly recommended for those who can't deal with aggressive strains that make you cough.

This was a light potency strain overall, perfect for a little relaxation while keeping all mental activities running at a high level. Starting off with a delayed effect, it smoothly built to a light, buzzy body feeling that had us motivated and on our feet for most of the review. There was a little bit of head/eye pressure cycling, but overall it was rather clear-headed, with only a bit of euphoria and the desire to shirk responsibilities breaking up the motivated state. As it went along, the body relaxation became more apparent but was still not that direct — as if the mental relaxation moved downwards.

This was a superb Indica-dominant cross, bottom line. The overall grow quality and bag appeal was impressive, while the perfect harvest timing seemed like the veritable cherry on top. The two parent strains really aren't known for their taste and smell (both are generally chosen for their potency), but this cross was still very pleasant to smoke, possessing a nice lemony bite. We recommend this most highly as an after work or late-night med, as it puts the user in a very sedative and relaxed state where even basic communication can at times be too much to deal with. Sinking into the couch and enjoying the mood elevation and warm body presence is probably the most likely effect of this med; a real Indica experience despite the slightly rushy start. Great job by the Biocare crew — it was a very well cared-for sample overall that lasted longer than most and retained medicinal potency well into hour #2.

            G-13 x Black Widow
        
Bred by Mr. Nice Seedbank

This was one of the frostiest samples we've gotten in some time, with a thick coating of trichomes covering nearly every surface. The structure of this sample was also very good, with a moderate density and a hearty stickiness.

Though it's not an aroma that really marks itself as distinct or uniquely enjoyable, this G-13 Widow produced a lovely sharp lemon-pine scent with a bit of muskiness and also sweetness in the mix. Lemon is at the forefront though for sure, and it was nicely pungent once broken apart.

It was mostly a fresh and clean-tasting vegetation with a pine element to it — not really something we'd seek out, but certainly not a bad flavor. The smoke was smooth despite being rather thick, and the final ash was a very light gray, indicating that it had a proper flush.

To start, this strain had us feeling slightly racy, with an elevated heart beat, a boost of energy, and the urge to be social and active. A lot of head and eye pressure fluctuations, a buzzing warm body, and a slightly slow/hazy mental state were the other initial pieces of this surprisingly Sativa-oriented start. It was at this point where we had a bit of disagreement on the overall tone of the experience — one reviewer continued on the energetic and clear-headed path while the other two were knocked for a relaxing Indica loop. It seems the time of day and situation might play a larger role in the effects of this med than some others — the energetic one was a mid-day review when the reviewer had things to do, and he functioned well. The others were in the morning and later at night when both reviewers were not busy, so the heavy effects seemed to come through harder. In any case, there was strong body relaxation, mental relaxation, and a persistent ocular/forehead effect that continued well into the 2nd hour. The end of the experience was rather sedative and could easily lead into sleep.

This cross was originally made by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds when he was operating Stone Mountain Wellness in Longmont, CO.

This particular phenotype selection from seed stock leans heavily towards the Ghost's OG side of the spectrum.  Blue Moonshine adds an interesting musky sweetness to the zesty ginger-lemon OG flavor of the Ghost, and serves to thicken up the smoke as well as increase the heaviness of the effects. 

A light and floaty feeling throughout the head and body starts things off, feeling very Ghost-influenced at first, but some body heaviness creeps in later in the duration and grounds the experience a bit.  Ghost Moonshine is a very relaxing strain but is still somewhat "up" mentally, keeping the mood of the user elevated though steady.

Regardless of expectations going in, this strain had very high marks in all areas, with the smell and appearance especially drawing our attention. We definitely think that this is daytime medicine, as the mental and physical stimulation it gave would likely keep a patient awake at night with mind racing. We actually liked a lower dosage of this strain in terms of daily use, as the psychedelic elements we experienced at high dosages made it less functional both mentally and socially — but those adventurous 'psychonaut' types among the MMJ patient population will likely enjoy those elements of the experience.

Bred by Rare Dankness as part of their Ghost Train Haze series pairing legendy OG Kushes with their Nevil's Wreck (Arcata Trainwreck x Neville's Haze) male, this strain redefined maximum potency when High Times tested it at the Cannabis Cup, being named the Strongest Strain on Earth.

Wide claw-shaped dark olive green sepals arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of red bronze pisitls, and supreme coverage by long, thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average heads

Universally loved by our staff, the aroma didn't have any real hints of the Ghost's OG side of the lineage, but that didn't seem to matter at all. The scent is a wonderfully sweet yet fresh scent that has hints of anise, grenadine, and citrus mixed together into what several reviewers described as "cherry-limeade" or a similar sweet-tangy-tart combination. It's very complex and engaging, and also has just enough of a bite post-grind to remind you of the OG and Haze lineage. Top-notch aroma here, one that Trainwreck and Haze lovers especially will enjoy.

After the world-class aroma experience, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed with the flavor, but this one held up very well. The flavor was a little more OG-tinged than the smell was, giving hints of the pine cleaner type of sharpness combined with a hint of the floral Haze sweetness. One this we really enjoyed about this strain was its extremely smooth smoking experience, which never really gave us the urge to cough and retained flavor to about the midway point of the bowl. 

We had some slight disagreements on the overall potency of this hybrid among the review staff — some staff felt that it was in the top 10% of medicine potency-wise, while others (one of whom who has had the strain previously) thought that it just didn't get to that upper level. That said, the uplifting and energizing effects that kick off this experience will make any real Sativa-lover happy, but might border on anxious for those who struggle with the more energizing strains. A strong 'facial mask' feeling of buzzing pressure kept up at a high level, and our eyes tended to be rather red during the early parts of the duration especially… not a 'stealth' med really. Multiple reviewers reported quite a lot of borderline psychedelic activity, including slight auditory and visual hallucinations and at times felt a bit of sensory overload. At lower dosages than our standard KR review portion, the effect was more manageable and sociable, but otherwise it was a bit too challenging mentally to stay engaged with anything other than one's own thoughts for the most part. The main effects began their decline at about 1.5 hours, but the energy and mental activity kept up through almost the end, when a little bit of a Sativa crash crept in and we felt a little stunted mentally and in a somewhat dreamlike mental state to finish.

Thought by some to be the "mother" of all OG Kush strains to follow, Ghost's cut of OG Kush is a legendary clone-only cut that was possessed by OverGrow.com forum member known as "OrgnKid,” who then passed it onto another OverGrow.com member known as "Ghost," who then passed it on to a few select individuals. Possessing one of the most elemental and unique taste/smell packages in all of cannabis, it is clear why kushes have become such a big deal on the scene. While nobody knows the lineage for sure [good evidence also points to Tahoe], it's still widely thought to be an off-shoot of the Triangle Kush, which came out of Florida in the early 1990's.

Unknown

See above — possibly original "OG Kush" cut, passed through overgrow.com forum members, from OrgnKid to Ghost, who then distributed it to select individuals... eventually making its way into Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds' hands.  The stories about OG Kush as a strain vary greatly, but many "in the know" say that it's true mother plant is the Triangle Kush, which came out of Florida in the 1990's and was named after the "Triangle" of Florida's main marijuana-producing cities (Jacksonville, Tampa, and Miami).

Absolutely one of the purest-smelling Kush varieties on the planet, its ginger ale + citrus + Kush pine-sol qualities are unmatched. Terpene heavy at all times.

Like the smell, the flavor is pure lemon cleaner/spice-heavy Kush, with the aftertaste hanging in the mouth and throat for a long time after smoking.

Floaty and cerebral, the high comes on strong at first but is never pushy.  It takes the user on a ride full of positivity and laughter — it's really a social med and can totally change the mood of your day/night.  It's potent in the sense that it "cuts through" almost anything you're already smoking, taking over the effect itself rather than playing nice with the other strain(s).  But it's not potent in the "oh no, I shouldn't have smoked that much" sense — it's a very even, non-pushy med that can sit in the background of your mind if need-be.  If you ever get a chance to try this strain, jump at the opportunity — it's truly one of the most amazing and unique strains in the world. 

Scott suggests that the Ghost is best grown in a SCROG-style grow with 1 plant every 9?-12? square, pruned heavily on the bottom to fatten up the top.

Original familial lineage in the Afghanistan-Pakistan mountains, though this particular iteration likely came out of Florida, USA.

The very dense Giga Bud is bred by G-13 Labs, and is a great yielding strain. An early flowering strain ideal for indoor growing. I hear that these buds get massive and compact. I can tell my sample was an exact replica of what I've been hearing about. Having a grinder handy will make it easier to prepare these flowers for medication. Strong mind numbing effects that deliver a long lasting, and strong medicinal experience.

Looks like a lightly frosted Christmas tree. Huge - dense, almost rock like buds, lightly sprinkled with cloudy and amber trichomes on its multi-green surface.

Smells like a mix of skunky fuel and hash.

Tastes very earthy and is a bit peppery and spicy. Leaves a hash like taste on exhale.

Will give you cotton-mouth so be prepared with something tasty to drink. Creates a strong sedating high that makes you feel happy but lazy. Impairs mental abilities like focus, concentration, and speech.

Rumored to be OG Kush x F1(undisclosed strain by original breeders) x Durban Poison. Girl Scout Cookies is one of the most sought-after strains on the market and as a result, is often a favorite choice for growing at home in states where cultivation is legal. Choosing the right cannabis seeds is important when cultivating Girl Scout Cookies. Growers who want effective results time after time look for feminized Girl Scout Cookies seeds to ensure that all plants are female and their harvest will be somewhat predictable

Unknown in Truth; popularly claimed to be OG Kush x Durban Poison, or OG Kush x Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban Poison)

Very little is known about the origin of Girl Scout Cookies. The only certainty is it was bred in San Francisco, California, sometime in the last couple of years; perhaps 2011 or 2012.







The strain was developed by a Nor-Cal group of associates known simply as the Cookie Family. From there, different phenotypes (some perhaps bag-seeds) have been distributed throughout the United States. Most notable of this array of Girl Scout Cookies is the "Forum Cut," made available through internet networking among breeders.

Girl Scout Cookies has a tall, branchy, OG-like structure, leaning towards the appearance of a true kush. It has dark leaves that turn black with a complete cold-water flush and have extremely long, thick, wine-red petioles, or leaf stems, that are actually longer than the leaf is in length.

To its name, Girl Scout Cookies has a sweet and spicy, oven-baked smell.

From the two disclosed parents, Durban Poison and OG Kush, there are taste elements of skunky peppermint and the slightest lemon zest. The "F1" unknown parent may be responsible for the yeasty bread-like taste that dominates the pallet.

Northern California, circa 2011-2012

The original is very hard to acquire as the Cookie Fam strictly limits its availability. The "forum cut" is also only available as a clone and many believe it to be the original, though the Cookie Fam disputes that claim. Many seed companies have also developed similar strains by the same name.

            Glass Slipper is an example of the Dutch breeding scene getting their hands on one of the United States' most wanted clone-only strains and fusing it with some of the best they have to offer.  "The White" is a supremely potent variety thought to be evolved out of the OG Kush family line, while Cinderella 99 is a much-loved Brothers Grimm classic that was once seen as the pinnacle of Dutch breeding projects.  A fusion of these two strong genetic lines has produced a wonderful hybrid in Glass Slipper, one which retains the Kushy elements of the mother but has an interesting floral-sweet-fruity twang and a more cerebral effect added by the Cinderella 99 males.
        
            Krome's "The White" x Pineapple pheno Cinderella 99 males
        
            Krome's "The White" is thought to have come from an S1 (self-pollinated) bagseed which came out of Triangle, an elite Florida strain that many believe is an original OG Kush line.  This strain has earned a reputation as one of the most potent clone varieties in the world, regularly testing at 23%+ THC and looking like something out of a genetic experiment to maximize trichome production.  This strain was created by Dutchgrown Seeds when their lead breeder got her hands on The White and had a stable of pineapple-scented original Brothers Grimm Cinderella 99 males waiting to provide pollen.
        
            Big creamy orange-colored nugs with a rounded top shape are the most common in this variety, with the structure taking most directly after The White's rounded loafy Kush structure.  The pistils upon close inspection are actually a very deep orange, but when combined with the thick trichome coverage, the appearance takes on a creamsicle orange quality which makes it very appealing to the eye.  The trichomes are densely-packed but tend to have smaller heads, something common in both parental varieties.
        
            The Kush elements present in The White are the most noticeable aroma in most phenotypes, but there is a pungent fruity, floral sweetness lurking in the background that comes out in the Cinderella-dominant plants especially.  Spicy, dank, with a hint of sweetness - Glass Slipper is often more complex and engaging than either parent strain, a complex interplay of pineapple-citrus musk and Kush.
        
            A soft sweetness with a spicy background on the inhale, then a dank Kush-influenced finish on the exhale matches the aroma, but almost in reverse.  Some phenos will have a sweeter flavor, but The White tends to dominate in this area.
        
            Glass Slipper is very potent thanks to its genetic pedigree, and it hits hard, fast, and early.  At times, it can cause moments of a wandering mind where the user walks around aimlessly, thinking deeply on a variety of subjects almost without realizing it.  GS is more cerebral than The White, but has the same tendency to knock the user's legs out from underneath them at high dosages.  Strong to the eyes and head, it has shown benefits with ocular issues and migraines, while improving mood and never approaching the anxiety-ridden side of the Sativa spectrum — it's a great choice for any time of day thanks to its hybrid nature and balanced effects.
        
            Glass Slipper does well in soil or hydro setups, and grows medium-tall when given adequate root space.  The yield is larger than The White on its own and the plant tends to form a rather strong central cola despite moderate amounts of side branching.  It normally makes a good SCROG plant due to the tendency to grow an even canopy.  Coco coir works especially well with this plant, matching the yields of hydro but offering more flavor — in our experience, the best Glass Slipper that we've had has been coco-grown.

Gold Berry (or Blue Gold) is a beautiful strain with an inviting odor and caked with red-hairs. The smoke was very pleasant and relaxed the body as an indica should do. The pain relief was great, but it didn't last very long. I still had a great buzz, but felt the pain in my back return about 30 minutes after toking. Ended up falling asleep from re-medicating a few more times. Excellent bedtime smoke.

Pot of Gold x Blueberry

Crazy amounts of orange hairs protrude from the frosty - small calyxes. Big fluffy buds with excellent leaf to bud ratio.

A pleasant citrus on the sweet side, medium pungence. Very nice

A smoke you feel, a little harsh but still pleasant. A bit of berries. Leaves a bit of a skunky after-taste.

Quick hitting, but quite mild. The head rush doesn't last long, but the body high is sure to get you relaxed and ready for bed.

An incredibly sweet and potent strain, Golden Goat is a sativa-dominant plant with a strongly cerebral and social effects package.  Its large yield of tangy buds makes it an excellent fusion of production and connoisseur-grade final product.

Freak Island Sweet Skunk x (Hawaiian x Romulan)

The strain was created in Topeka, Kansas largely by accident when a male Hawaiian-Romulan pollinated MrDank's freak Island Sweet Skunk mother.  The best plant of the resulting seeds was named "Golden Goat" after the smell of Golden Goat Recycling machines in the dead of summer, when all the soda syrup smells would mingle in the hot sun.


If you're a medical patient in Colorado and want to purchase some Golden Goat flower to try, be sure to visit Root MMC!


Its light green and pink coloration recall its Hawaiian sativa side while the aroma calls upon the ISS mother most directly.

Incredibly sweet mentholated lemon zest and cherry grenadine smell that brings to mind both the ISS and Hawaiian sides of the lineage 

Exactly like the smell, it has a complex mentholated sweet-sour-spicy tropical fruit flavor that lingers on the palate and perfumes the room with a spicy, incense-heavy Haze-like smoke 

This strain exhibits heavy, potent sativa effects that can be a little much for the anxiety-prone at times, with a racing heart, buzzing body, and near-frenzied thought patterns.  For those who like racier sativas, it will provide a wonderful creative and social boost, seemingly making it impossible to sit down at times.







It's a strain that works best on a sunny day with friends rather than a night home alone.  The Romulan element adds a quality pain reduction and muscle tension relief element that seems to kick in most strongly later in the duration, making the body more able to keep up with the brain's demands. 

Takes after the Hawaiian sativa side of the family structure-wise, growing tall and consuming a lot of root space in ideal conditions.  It's a branchy plant that grows best untopped, but liked judicious pruning of lower lateral stems to encourage top growth.  The wispy structure fills out late in harvest, taking on a golden appearance as it gets closer to finish.

Good Medicine was bred by Bodhi Seeds in California and is a Harlequin female, Appalachian male cross. Bodhi developed such knockout high-THC strains like Prayer Tower, Buddha's Hand and Tigers Milk.

            Harlequin x Appalachian
        
The dried buds are often spear-like and conical in nature.  A lime green to dark green color scale with bright orange pistils is very common.

The ripened flowers smell fruity with musky, earthy after tones.

While many CBD crosses end up tasting like hay or hemp, the Appalachian lends enough flavor to qualify this is an enjoyable smoke, especially in oil form where it can lean towards the sweet side of the scale.

At 1:1 CBD to THC, and testing around 15% THC, Good Medicine is a great selection for a subdued and relaxing experience. The extended use of this strain, espeically from smoking, increases the amount of CBN consumed. CBN has been demonstrated to be a great sleep aid.

Gorilla Glue flower is sweet with hints of sharp sourness that tends to vary from batch to batch. Burnt flowers produce a very strong skunk perfume that is thick in the air and sure to entice others nearby to ask what you are smoking on.

Bred specifically for maximum THC, the flavor of Gorilla Glue can be a bit muted and indistinguishable from other strains. This isn't to say that it tastes bad, but it certainly doesn't have the diversified pallet many other strains have.

Gorilla Glue was specifically bred for its THC content. Therefore, it isn't the best sleep aid but the racing effect some experience will ease into a general stoniness after an initial rush.







The effect is typical of most OG varietals with an early onset of a euphoric rush and a gentle relaxation easing in thereafter for up to several hours. Gorilla Glue is sure to touch on several symptoms including pain management and is sure to trigger apatite stimulation.

Very Purple with orange tendrils, almost no green to be seen.

Roasted berries and potpourri.

A soft smooth start gives way to a solid body high.  Its latent hybrid nature gives just enough head high to be considered a solid mid-day strain as well as an evening variety.

            Possibly a sister phenotype of Granddaddy Purple and several of the other popular Purple strains that have floated around California for the better part of 15 years, Grape Ape is one of the most famous and beloved.  Its smooth and relatively clear-headed though narcotic effect distinguishes it from the often heavy-feeling Purple family and make it a more versatile choice for daytime use.  Its rock hard buds smell of sweet grape incense and turn a mottled to deep royal purple by the time it finishes flowering.
        
            Afghani x Skunk #1
        
            The exact origins of this strain are unclear, but Apothecary Genetics (the most common source of the strain over the last 10 years) claims it to be Afghani x Skunk #1.  There are a variety of Purple strains that share similar qualities, and many believe them to be different expressions of the same genetics, while others see some additional Sativa influence in the Ape that doesn't exist in the GDP, Mendo Purps, and Purple Indica varieties.
        
            There are a couple of different phenotypes of Grape Ape in existence — it's unclear if some are S1 versions or simply mislabeled, but some phenotypes are completely purple and others (more commonly) are a mottled green and purple.  The entirely purple phenotype is often referred to as "True Grape Ape", but both share a similar structure and deep orange pistil color.  Grape Ape has rather large calyxes with moderate to high trichome coverage — it's not quite as frosty as its possible cousin GDP, but most people enjoy the flavor more.  The leaves are medium-wide and often turn from deep green to purple as flowering progresses.
        
            Grape Ape has a sweet but still musky scent which has strong notes of grape Kool-Aid with background hints of nag champa incense.  From a distance or through a bag, it often has a skunky element to it, but the sweetness and grape qualities really come out once its broken apart.
        
            A fairly direct translation of the aroma, the flavor is the same mix of grape sweetness and musky incense notes, offering both a fairly strong initial flavor and a lingering aftertaste.  The smoke is normally thick and can often hit the throat somewhat hard like many Purple strains.
        
            Grape Ape starts off rather strongly, with a package of eye and facial effects which signal the start of a rather potent experience.  The early heady effects blend with a creeping body buzzing into a harmonious whole by 30-45 minutes, making Grape Ape feel like a true hybrid for the most part.  It's a strain which is definitely relaxing but also uplifts the mood and at times provides a slight burst of energy to start, simply because it makes the user feel good.  As it progresses though, the more Indica side of the effects dominate and the mindstate becomes more sedate and meditative.  Muscle relaxation, light pain relief, mood elevation, anti-anxiety properties, and appetite stimulation are all parts of the Grape Ape experience, making it a favorite medical choice for patients seeking a middle-of-the-road Indica experience replete with flavor and bag appeal.
        
            Grape Ape responds well to moderately heavy feeding and fourishes in both hydro or soil mediums.  The purple coloration comes out naturally but is encouraged by cooler temperatures.  It's a plant of short stature and grows most commonly as a small low-lying bush, responding well to topping but not normally needing it.  Netting and other methods of keeping the canopy even will reward the grower with an even canopy of medium-sized but extremely dense flowers.

Offered by Gage Green Genetics, there is some controversy surrounding the original source of the strain with some indication that GG's mentor JojoRizo originally bred the clone-only version of the strain under the name Sour Grapes, and that Gage Green later backcrossed JojoRizo's breeding stock to produce the seed line.

Dark cream pistils and mindblowing trichome coverage make this strain extremely visually impressive

A fresh candy grape scent greeted us in the jar, and sweetened up even further when ground. There were no traces of the other half of the lineage, it was pure purple grape goodness.

Syrupy grape with notes of dark blossoms

With a fairly quick onset about 3 minutes after the first hit, a buzzy and energetic feeling throughout the body made us feel light and capable. The eyes filled with pressure and burned slightly, a feeling that carried on throughout the experience. A bit rushy and cerebral, it had us a little on the anxious side, alternating with spacey/laughy moments. About 1.5 hours in, it changed to a more Indica experience, with some muscle relaxation properties, heavy eyes, and a tinge of tiredness. It left us feeling slightly drained and tired as it faded out.

A clone-only strain that was passed around the British Columbia scene in the 1980s after Breeder Steve of Spice of Life seeds, according to legend, found a the clone with the label "the one to grow"

Solid trichome count and dark orange pistils are characteristic of this strain.

The very sweet and tangy citrus scent the strain is named after are present, but with only an average pungency. A very nice smelling strain.

Unfortunately, we never experienced any of the taste associated with this strain. It may be this cut carries the scent but not much taste or that our sample was somehow compromised.

The initial effect is a warm rush, or pulsing feeling, of blood and medicine to the rear of the head and ears. It produces a sativa yawn and an inclination to stretch out and relax. Body energy level was elevated but only momentarily, then it drifts into a basic and non-descript sativa high but not particularly strong.

The Gum comes off as a strain in the fruity section of things, smells real nice but lacks in taste. It is good medicine in the sense that happiness and positive mental attitude are paramount to any patient for any reason. The Gum will provide this, it just won't do it with a lot of "gusto" or for very long.

Unknown

Also known as Indiana Bubblegum, the original (less marketable) moniker was Gum

The Gum looked pretty good in the jar, and most reviewers commented they would buy some based on the "bag appeal" alone. It was lime green with light orange pistils and average trichome coverage.

Not Juicy Fruit, but a soft, sweet gummy aroma that makes you think of kids candy. Very pleasant but not overly pungent.

This is the average earthy taste you come to expect from a non-descript medication. A little on the harsh side but not unpleasant in any manner.

Comes on with medium speed and then delivers a steady experience throughout, no waves. You will feel sinus pressure and and initial sativa traits mentally. The scatter-brain sensation will fade fairly quickly and leave a good body medicine in its place.

            A fusion of some serious Indica genetics in the Bubba and the Kunduz Afghani, the Haze element adds some hybrid vigor and variation in structure.  Overall though, the plants are very Bubba-dominant in structure, finishing at times with nearly black foliage and purple buds with large calyxes that form the signature "crowns" seen in the Bubba.  The dark green leaves look heavily Indica but the Haze really kicks in during flowering, when the plants stretch to twice their height and begin taking on the signature superglue-like smell of the 1994 Positronics Haze.
        
            Kunduz Afghani x (Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x 1994 Positronics Haze)
        
            The Kunduz Afghani used in this cross was found and brought back from Afghanistan — the Kunduz region is known as Afghanistan's premier hash-producing area, making this plant an especially frosty specimen that adds its trichome coverage to anything it touches.  The name "Hanis" came from its Afg"hanis"tan roots.  This strain was created in Texas by a grower named "Tierra Rojo" who bred almost exclusively outdoors for a time, later moving into the Colorado medical marijuana scene, including an entry into the 2011 Denver High Times Medical Cup.
        
            Interesting sharp smell that brings to mind superglue or acetone, it has a background of Bubba-like coffee/chocolate sweetness.  Its vaguely skunky and sharp scent pre-grind really explodes into a complex and acrid aroma once it's broken apart, lingering on the hands and in the air.

            Very much like the scent, it has the same almost chemical glue attack, with a musky, hashy Bubba-like finish with notes of hash and earthy qualities from the Afghan.

            The Haze part of the hybrid is apparent early on, as this strain has moments of raciness and an definite mood/energy uptick as its early effect.  Lots of eye pressure and a buzzing body move the experience on towards its more relaxing second half.  Quality muscle and mental relaxation blend with a sense of equilibrium mentally (both in mood and function), making this feel like a true hybrid for most of the experience.
        
            Grows well with a long vegetative period, topped and trained to form a multi-cola bush.  Hanis responds well to "super-cropping" and heavy training, but still normally stretches at least twice its height in flower thanks to the Haze influence.  Letting it go later (especially in sub-75 degree temperatures) will encourage the development of the deep colors and a more narcotic effect.

Hashplant will knock you out if you're not careful with dosage. But if you can manage not to fall asleep, you'll experience a pleasant body warmth and pain relief along with a relaxed and lazy mind-state that will see the hours fly by. Not suggested for daytime use except for patients that don't have much to do, this would make a superb nighttime smoke for those who struggle with sleep and pain issues in the evenings.

Afghani Landrace

A clone only indica strain that landed in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s before being taken into seed form by Nevil Schoenmaker's Seed Bank in 1987.

Indica-dominance was clear here, with dark greens in leaves and calyxes as well as deep blood red pistils. Generous trichome coverage combined with above average density gave this a classic look.

Surprisingly fruity and sweet-smelling when ground up, but also carried some of the signature earthy/hashy/piney smells that the lineage is known for. 

It's a blend of earthy and hashy flavors that hits heavy despite being rather smooth on the throat.

This Hashplant was a bit of a creeper, reaching its full effects approximately 20 minutes after ingestion. The heavy and warm-feeling body and the corresponding feeling in the eyes set the tone for this strain's Indica-dominant effects. A distinct lack of motivation, some spaciness, and the urge to sit around were the main mental feelings this strain caused along with a bit of run-of-the-mill tiredness. However, it did a good job with body effects, delivering a narcotic-feeling experience that left the body very loose, relaxed, and pain-free. As it finished, the urge to sleep became even stronger, leaving our review staff in a sort of dazed state that was not conducive to productivity or even socialization.

One of the most visually-striking samples we've received, with quite the potency punch, as it knocked our review staff for a bit of a loop with its trippy effects full of hallucinations and a head-spinning initial attack. Once it calmed down a bit though it provided great mood elevation, relaxation, and mild pain relief. We'd warn beginners against this strain, as even a small 0.1g dosage was more than enough to put an experienced patient in another mental dimension for a solid 2.5 hours. If you want a bit of a rollercoaster ride and enjoy the taste of a Sour Diesel or Kush, you owe yourself to try this superb example of Headband, as it was by consensus the best example of it that we've ever tried.

Chemdog (Chem 91) x (Massachussets Super Skunk x Northern Lights)

Originally named Diesel #1 when made on the East Coast by a breeder known as Weasel, it was nicknamed Underdog, and Daywrecker Diesel, before making its way to California to be renamed Headband by a breeder called Loompa.
The Northern Lights used in the father was from original Sensi Seeds stock.

Stacked tight emerald green spearhead calyxes with occasional eggplant accented water leaves, brick red pistils, medium-length thick-stemmed trichomes with large heads

This is definitely a Diesel-tinged bouquet, especially before being ground up — it was very pungent in the jar, almost more than it was when handled. The mix of fuel, skunk, spice, bitter citrus, and rubber retains its pungency until it settles a bit, when the aroma changes to more of a soft, slightly sweet presence.

Much like the smell, but with more of a skunky, rubbery, fuel empahsis to it, and notes of citrus-pine sharpness, with a thick, expansive smoke.

The "phantom sweatband" feeling was in full effect with this sample, as all reviewers reported a near-immediate rush of blood to the head and that familiar constrictive feeling around the perimeter. Almost dizzying to start, this sample was truly potent and took even our experienced reviewers a bit by surprise.







Another interesting similarity was the shared experience of auditory hallucinations, with one reviewer reporting body vibrations coming from sounds and music far more than normal. The high was concentrated in the head, face, and eyes, with some visual hallucinations and an increase in "eye floaters." It eventually took us to a slightly more relaxed state, where the indica side came out a bit. The finish for this strain was very clean and actually seemed to give us a bump in energy instead of the more common sativa "crash."

The HDF gave me a pretty heavy, quick intoxication that had me laying in bed watching whatever channel happened to be on. I seriously forgot about the option of changing channels, it simlply didn't exist. This wasn't an activity based strain, but the combination of power and sleepiness, mixed with an excellent taste leads me to a favorable review. This was on the fence between an A- and a B+ with the nod coming for the duration and the terrific sleep it provided in a mid-day setting.

            Indica Dominant Hybrid
        
A potent clone only indica hybrid, Hell's OG is one of the original varietals of OG Kush. Disputed by many, the history of OG Kush and its many variances is lush and an exciting adventure to investigate. Hell's OG entered the public sphere in the early 1990s. Prior to that, it is rumored that OG Kush was a family heirloom that went back decades in the Lake Tahoe region of Northern California.

Clone Only OG

The specifics of how the Hell's Angels acquired the strain from the original garden are unclear but legend holds that it was given as a payment for some misgiving. The Hell's Angels further profited from the strain in Southern California into the year 2000, selling $8000 pounds through the grape vine to rappers such as Snoop Dogg whom popularized the strain calling it OG Kush. Hell's OG is now one of the most prolific OG strains on the market. 

Hell's OG develops interspaced and spiraled flower nodes, creating small colas. Swollen, dense calyxes result in a chunky look. Small buds are common and completely natural for this strain. 

Hell's OG smells boldly of pine and musk.

OG strains are known for their enveloping, alarmingly putrid stenches. Albeit rank as an ambient smell, that pungency carries a strong after taste of pleasant sourness. Hell's OG features sweetness that overtones citrus and astringent.

Hell's OG has an effect typical to indica plants. However, the terpene called pinene, associated with pine trees, juniper bushes and the like, dominate the strain to produce a very broad-spectrum effect.

I've had similar "stand-up indicas" before, but this one had the most apparent dual effect and was a very welcome surprise - the body relaxation is palpable, but without stupefying intoxication.

The "creepiest", in fact I experienced a subtle rise for a near half hour before reaching full effect. This one had all of the classic properties of a strong indica (heavy head, eyes & body) and yet I felt the place to be was on my feet. Though I didn't look it, I was able to stay functioning and mentally sharp.

This strain shined most in its effects, which is really what's most important — the most unique part about it was how quickly and directly the body relaxation was noticed. We also appreciated how the initial mental potency faded away and left behind all the good body relaxation we desired, converting what was a little heavy at first into an effect that felt very clear-headed and functional. We like this Hindu Kush as a daytime type of Indica that will help ease the aches and pains of a day both physically and mentally, while not being overbearing at all and retaining function.

Stabilized landrace genetics from the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan

Broad spade-shaped asparagus green sepals arranged in closed stacked calyxes, streaked with shocks of rust pistils, and well above average coverage by average-stemmed hooked trichomes with large heads, along with small lithocists and peltate trichomes

The aroma in the bag was an understated combination of lightly fruity, musky, and earthy smells that blended together into an almost indecipherable mix. Once it was ground up, it took on a strong earthy element that reminded us of expensive soil — behind that lurked a slightly acrid and musky smell with a tinge of lemons. This one was a bit confusing to us, but enjoyable and pungent enough to please the staff.

While one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) experienced no real issues when smoking, two other reviewers disliked the flavor simply because the quality of the smoke seemed to burn the throat slightly and cause immediate coughing. The flavor itself was unremarkable regardless, and was mostly earthy/musky with a hint of sweetness present.

Eye pressure and a near-immediate body relaxation were the first effects of this Hindu Kush. The fast-acting body relief was surprising, as the relaxation parts of most strains come on beyond the initial effects, once the buzzing or waving feelings have subsided. This one has us pulled down into the couch in no time, improving our mood, but keeping things relatively sedate and calm nonetheless. The potency lasted at its near-peak level through an hour, having us feeling a little bit slow mentally, but cleared up after that point. Fortunately, the body relaxation lasted longer than the mental effects, which made this a clear-headed relaxer for most of its duration.

Hailing from the East, In The Pines is a combination of Afghan and Thailand genetics. Kush comes from the high steppes of Central Asia, while Pineapple originates from Southeast Asia. Together, the fruits and earthy tones combine to make a flavorful and aromatic cannabis experience. This strain is revered for its terpene profile while it also provides consistent yields in the garden.

Long, frilled, and orange pistils stand atop small, wispy buds.

Citrus fruit, but not of the ordinary orange or lemon. Not as sweet as a skunk, it is unique among many “fruity” strains while having a back-edge of juniper.

In the Pines is all about the flavor. Potent as it is, it is the flavor that attracts people to this strain. The fruity aroma transpires to flavor perfectly. A stable flower, it is used heavily in concentrates and adds a unique touch to many mixed varietals while it can also stand by itself for a rich fruity terpene experience.

I was a bit surprised by this strain because though I found this sample to be visually appealing, it did not have such a fierce look to it overall, it was just pretty. I judged by the cover once again and once again I was wrong, this is not a beginner strain, and with its short delay I would recommend being patient to let the med do its work before trying to force an effect by increasing dosage. Don't worry it's coming.

Dark green with very contrasting white mid ribs on leaves.

Sweet berry kush was the dominant scent reported, with a very high pungency level and appeal.

The most prolific flavors found were soil, pine, and "earthy". It was a bit harsh, but not enough to keep someone away, and it had good expansion.

A short two minute delay led to a smooth relaxing heady state of sheer relief from a stressful day. One of the first reported effects was a butterfly/stomach feeling which was somewhat unusual for our team. Over the next 20 minutes this strain produced a strong rising effect leading to high level spacyness and distortion of equilibrium. A fun exciting ride was the dominant description, but we also found a lack of presentable functionality, temporary introversion, and avoiding human contact. Relief came for all after about the forty five minute mark and most were able to get back to the comfortable state the first ten minutes had offered.

With its distinctive and pungent aroma, it's exceptional trichome coverage, and long-lasting and medicinal effects, Ingrid is truly a winner of a strain. This one would do the trick for almost any type of pain or discomfort, and its relaxing effects were both mentally and physically medicating. It would probably get on top of most patients who aren't heavy users, as even a 0.3g dose was enough to put a veteran into the "overwhelming" range at the onset. Its enduring medicinal-level efficacy was the key component of its high score, as there was almost no drop-off in effects as the 2nd hour elapsed, which is unusual.

Swiss Big Bud IBL

Ingrid was a strain developed from 2000-2007 from a Swiss variety of Big Bud commonly used for hash production, originally appearing in the San Francisco Bay area

 A uniform medium green with huge tall trichomes and pale orange hairs. It had some of the best trich coverage in terms of density and trich head size that we've seen; seems like a true Hashplant. Nicely swelled and bubbly calyxes

Very strange, uncanny, and pungent odor that smells like sweet citrus dog poop. Especially pre-grind, that is all you can think of — it's a weird putrid sweetness with a sharp attack. After it's grind, it got even stronger with a component of herbiness but mostly an acrid musk and the sweet citrus poo smell. 

Fortunately it didn't taste like it smelled, and instead produced an ethereal and herby taste with notes of sandalwood with notes of sandalwood that almost reminded us of a Haze. Another interesting trait is the wonderful almost menthol-citrus sweet smell the actual smoke had, as it left the room smelling fragrant. The taste wasn't overt at any point, but the smoke was very pleasing and smooth with no coughing.

Right off the bat, this strain produced a strong experience, with low eyes and a rising warmth that entered the head, face, and eyes (especially the eyes, which were almost burning). It was nearly dizzying, making it a little bit difficult to walk around without getting a little unbalanced or having to take it a little slower than normal. Once the initial attack subsided (about 30-45 minutes), a glorious and medicating body high was the main effect. Superb relaxation throughout the entire body with a good deal of warmth and the urge to stretch and yawn makes this one perfect for relaxing after a day of physical activity. It stayed at medicinal levels well into the 2nd hour and is one of the better body-centric strains we've had recently.

A worldly fusion of inter-continental proportions, this cross from Bodhi Seeds fuses a very rare clone-only creation from Chemdog (of the Chem Dawg strain family fame) in Giesel with Ace Seeds' exotic but relatively quick-finishing Bangi Haze. The various phenotypes range from the expected stank of the Giesel to the complex spicy incense-heavy aroma of the Haze, but the most choice phenotypes will exhibit an almost sweet lemony-fuel spice bouquet that is truly something extraordinary. It produces fairly large nugs which often have a uniquely greasy resin profile and normally have moderate leaf coverage.
Isaac Haze has strong ocular properties and definitely provides a boost of energy and mental positivity. Though the early stages of some more Haze-dominant phenotypes can be a bit anxious and speedy, it falls short of being considered "racy" and that stage falls to the wayside rather quickly regardless, paving the way for an anxiety-free experience replete with appetite stimulation and anti-nausea properties.

Giesel (ChemDawg D x Massachusetts Super Skunk) x Ace Seeds Bangi Haze (Congo x Nepalese)

A recent (2011) hybrid by Bodhi Seeds, this strain's origins are somewhat unclear except that it went up for international sale during 2011.  The story of the Giesel revolves around the breeder known as Chemdog, the same man who is responsible for popularizing and breeding the majority of the ChemDawg family line.  The Giesel combined his Chem D (germinated in 2001 from the original seed stock which produced the original '91 Chem) with the notorious clone-only Massachusetts Super Skunk, which was involved in the creation of Sour Diesel as well.  This serious pedigree made a great match for the exotic Bangi Haze, which comes from the worldly Ace Seeds, a firm which specialized in unique landrace varieties.

A mostly pale green plant as it grows, the finished product is equally light in coloration, exhibiting an array of almost golden tones mixed with light green leaves and creamy orange pistils.  It is extremely resinous and tends to leave an almost greasy feeling on the hands (when live, it feels almost like WD-40 sprayed on the fingers, then dries to a superglue-like tackiness after about 30 seconds) — the bag appeal is very high due to the thick trichome coverage and open structure.  Flower shape varies slightly depending upon phenotype, but they tend to be fairly slender but come to a rounded tip, often with a healthy "crown" of calyxes.

Again, it depends quite a bit upon phenotype what sort of aromas come out of this complex cross — however, most plants tend to have a unique citrus incense profile which tickles the nostrils, especially when freshly-ground.  Notes of sandalwood, tea, fuel, and softer floral notes all intermingle into what is a dream combination for many Sativa-lovers.  Pungent without being overwhelmingly stinky like the Giesel mom, this strain's smell is both exotic and familiar while remaining very pleasant.  Some phenotypes do exhibit the pungent Chem end of the spectrum, with skunky chem-fuel elements which come in at varying amounts.

The taste mostly matches the aroma of the various phenotypes, with the Giesel-dominant examples normally having a more pungent aftertaste than a frontal taste and the opposite existing with the more lemony-incense Haze varieties.  A bit of hashiness creeps into the flavor at times simply due to the thick trichome coverage which is present, but the smoke is very smooth and not particularly expansive.

Not a "creeper", the Isaac Haze quickly fills the user with a buzzing mental throughout both the mind and body as well as sending a burst of cycling pressure into the eyes and face.  It's a strain which increases the overall mood as well as the activity level of the user, especially early on when the effects are at their strongest.  As it settles into the bulk of the duration, it becomes more of a smoothly functional Sativa, with a continued body presence that keeps the user feeling at-ease but mostly active.  Some of the more Giesel-dominant phenotypes hit a bit harder to the eyes and face and may cause a bit more mental fogginess, but even they don't really inhibit function in all but the most detailed situations.

A vigorous plant which responds well to netting and other low-stress training methods, this hybrid will product fairly large colas even if topped, continually reaching for the light despite having relatively close node spacing.

Bred on Vancouver Island by legendary Canadian breeder, Breeder Steve.  Reportedly, Steve initially thought the parentage was Grapefruit x Big Skunk Korean, but after flowering the seeds, determined that he had mislabeled the male and that it was his Northern Lights/Haze.

A light green with pale orange pistils, dense, stout flowers prone to foxtaililng if harvested late.  Mid-long stemmed small-headed trichomes.

A truly delicious-smelling sample, it broadcasts an actual skunky smell that has a bit of sweetness while in the jar. When broken up, it blows up into a wonderful combination of sweet citrus, soil, and pine that is truly pungent. A top-notch example of both facets of this strain's signature aroma.

Like a piña colada stirred with a pine branch, it was a combination of velvety citrus with a pine twang.

After a short delay, the effects came on strongly — moments of staring off at nothing or deeply thinking about random subjects mingle into what amounts to a rather spacey experience to start. This strain was unique in that it kept up its potency for quite a long time, only dialing down slightly from its heady start as it went on. This I.S.S. became more apparent in the body as the minutes ticked by, relaxing the limbs quite a bit and warding off any aches and pains while maintaining a floaty brand of functionality. With occasional returns of the spaciness, this med provided a relaxing but functional ride that lingered for a really long time, eliminating the desire to re-medicate for nearly 4 hours.

This strain had elements of both parent strains evident in nearly all of its qualities, expressing the crisp, citrusy, cool elements of Jack Herer, and the kick of sweetness from Skunk. There were some flaws, but the harvest timing and trichome preservation made up for the hermie-induced tiny seeds that were spotted. This one was a great after-work unwinder type of med, that won't completely knock you to the couch, but trended towards sedentary activities and a singular focus. Its potency was medium-high to start, but declined sharply at about 2 - 2.5 hours, placing it in the intermediate patient area.

Spearhead-shaped dingley green sepals, arranged in open cluster calyxes, with bursts of mocha colored pistils, and average coverage with short hooked trichomes with large heads

The aroma mixed the best parts of both parent strains, with a citrus-kissed freshness coming from the Jack Herer and a heavy dose of sweetness from the Skunk. It reminded us of orange candy, and even a hint of gasoline-like sharp sweetness… its pungency wasn't amazing, but it was definitely a strong aroma that gained pungency after being broken apart.

Much like the post-grind smell, the flavor was fresh, sweet, and sugary with some citrusy elements. The smoke also seemed to perfume the room, making it smell spicy and pleasant. A very smooth smoke, this one was easy on the throat and did not cause coughing with out staff, even those who have asthma. The final ash was a medium-light gray, showing the flush was sufficient.

Coming on quickly, after only a few hits, this one made us feel slightly light-headed (not in a bad way… more 'floaty') but immediately calmed the nerves after a long day and placing us in a placid, peaceful mindset. Despite the inner calm, it did make our hearts race a bit to start, but that effect dissipated relatively quickly, at around 30-45 minutes, when the effects reached their peak. Though we felt a little spacey and couch-oriented randomly throughout the experience, it was calming enough to focus on one thing at a time, without being overtly sedative. We felt this one fell at near 50/50 Sativa/Indica in terms of effects… the second half was definitely on the relaxing side, but it never made us want to go to sleep.

Claw-shaped palm green sepals arranged in loose clustered open calyxes, with frequent bursts of long fiery orange pistils, and well above average coverage by thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with large heads, along with small lithocists and peltate trichomes

Lovers of this strain will definitely recognize the smell immediately, with its combination of crisp, almost "cool" aromas including lemon, eucalyptus, and cleaner. Though not a super-pungent strain in general, this one was definitely noticed in the bag and increased in pungency when broken apart. Spicy citrus Haze smell gave way to a more smooth and outright sweet orange cream type of aroma after the grind, both of which we loved.

While sharing qualities with both the pre and post-grind aroma, the flavor just fell short of those heights, giving more of a lightly sweet and floral, creamy orange flavor on the inhale, and a sharper more haze-like and spicy exhale. The flush seemed well-done, as the final ash was a fluffy light gray and white, and the smoke was very smooth throughout the experience.

Starting mainly in the face and jaw area, the effects came on smoothly yet strongly, but never bordered on overwhelming. The immediate mental uplift that this strain brought had us ready to get into a variety of activities, while the relaxing body presence also made sitting very comfortable in stretches. We liked how smooth this strain feels, as it didn't cause any heart-pounding or anxiety. It felt alternately Sativa and Indica, with some reviewers reporting more of an Indica effect later in the day and at higher dosages, while more Sativa effects seemed present at lower dosages and earlier in the day, in general. The effects took a decline at about an hour, but then stayed relatively constant through the end of the duration, seemingly disappearing with no after-effects.

Feeling a little rushy to start, this strain was a little deceiving — a major rush of warmth and pressure into the eyes and head normally signals the beginning of a Sativa crush, but this one backed off after about 30 minutes and remained relatively calm throughout. Somewhat bleary-feeling eyes remained past the initial potency, but otherwise the effects moved mostly into the body while just providing a sense of calmness and a lazy mood elevation. The lingering effects lasted longer than many strains, but the initial potency was shorter than many… bit of a give and take there.

This is a great example of the strain, and the strain itself is a unique and flavorful one — that makes for a wonderful combination.

            Orange Velvet x Space Queen
        
An exceptional example of a seed form with the orange punch flavor of Aeric77's Cali O[range] bred by TGA/Subcool.  The strain has experienced a resurgence in popurity thanks to the sweet citrus terpenes that it yields well in hash oil.

Spade-shaped pesto green sepals arranged in loose stacked open calyxes, snaked with shocks of rich gold pistils, and above average coverage by long thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with slightly small heads

The main aroma is a very orange/grapefruit-heavy citrus scent, but the backing spiciness comes out post-grind, releasing an almost garlic-like quality that almost took over the citrus. While it wasn't pungent in the realm of a Sour Diesel or something like that, it was very pungent for its type and even in a closed baggie could be detected from a few feet away, broadcasting its citrusy musk.

This one seemed to almost change at times, with some of us reporting a straight up orange drink (yep, like Tang) flavor, complete with the artificial quality of it all, while some got more of the spicy almost fuel-like qualities from the post-grind smell. The early hits tended to be more sweet, but left a bitter citrus oil taste lingering on the lips that hinted at the flavor of the later hits. This is an amazing orange strain though, most people will notice the similarities to the fruit immediately, whether it's the smell or the taste.

The effects of this Jilly Bean were felt quickly and strongly, but it never got us to that racy or anxious state that some strong starters do, keeping us feeling mentally at-ease the entire time, though mentally energized. An increase in eye pressure (but not facial pressure) and a fluttery feeling in the chest were the early physical manifestations, but mentally it was definitely uplifting, greatly improving our mood and showing no outward signs of medication, making it a good professional/"stealth" type of strain. There was some visual enhancement as well, and in general, our senses felt very aware and acute. Despite the energy, most of us found that we spent most of our time sitting and smiling rather than being up and active — this is a relaxing Sativa overall, feeling much like a 50/50 hybrid as the lineage would indicate. During the last hour or so of effects, the Indica side came out more, and we felt very relaxed, with strong muscle relaxation and at times heavy eyes.

Highland Thai x Afghani

Bred by Sensi Seeds, the strain was renamed Fruity Juice in recent offerings.

It normally finishes showing off an array of gorgeous colors, including purples and even pink at times.  

The tangy and fruity initial aroma has notes of grenadine, fruit punch, and lemons, with just a hint of a sharper almost body odor-like funk at times. 

The smell leads to a slightly hashy and yet almost creamy fruit flavor which is extremely pleasant and smooth on the throat.

The effect hovers between energetic and relaxing, exciting the mind but keeping the overall demeanor calm and collected.

55-60 Days

Very high marks in all "bag appeal" areas, this sample simply screams "connoisseur-grade cannabis".  The effects were definitely a mixed bag typical of most hybrids, with a Sativa start and a more Indica-feeling finish. It was a bit overwhelming initially and left us feeling a bit self-conscious about our extremely medicated appearance, even in environments that were MMJ-friendly. Otherwise it was a good mid-day type of med for days when the stresses of life an/or daily aches and pains are getting to you — watch the dosage if you're a newer patient though, as it can definitely get on top of you.

            Sweet Tooth x OG Kush
        
Named for the second tallest peak in the Himalayas. Not to be confused with the Dutch commercial strain named K2 of an entirely different lineage.

A seriously pretty sample, this one has the structure/appearance that many of our staff prefers over all others, which is the well-defined, slightly loose one where you can see each calyx clearly and all the trichomes covering them. The blend of light, frosty green with the jack-o-lantern orange pistils gave it a classic look, but with an the thick covering of trichomes.

This one instantly vaulted itself into the upper-echelon of our staff's "Must Smell" list — the uber-sweet "blue candy"-like smell also carried hints of oranges, strawberries and a grazzy/fresh quality one reviewer described as "spring breeze"… there was a tinge of cleaner in there too, like Formula 409. Pre-grind it was very pungent as well, with the ability to stink up a room when the jar/bag is opened — it was a stronger, sharper smell pre-grind as well, which was unique (it had notes of sweet curry, fall spices, and honey). Top notch smell here, simply put.

After the smell being one of the high points of the last month or so (seriously, it smells that good), it was hard for the taste to live up to the billing, and that played out here. The dominant taste was a piney lime that has musky/sharp elements that brought to mind the OG part of the lineage… there was a sweetness present, but it wasn't nearly as sweet as the smell. 

This med seemed to hit our crew slightly different, with one reporting 75% Sativa effects, one reporting a 50/50 split, and another reporting 75% Indica-dominant feelings. It seems as if being in a different environment controls how the effects play out — reviewers were solitary seemed to have more of an Indica experience while others that were in work/social situations seemed to trend Sativa. Regardless, it started off with strong eye effects (not a stealth med at all), forehead/temple pressure, and ringing in the ears… seemed heavily Sativa at first. The potency was almost too much at times, especially for the work situations — moments of spacing out were common. Once the blast of initial potency moved on, the cloudy vision and eye effects contributed to a feeling of slight tiredness and fairly thorough mental/physical relaxation.

OG Kush x Train Wreck (T4)

According to the breeder, DNA Genetics, the goal with this cross was to combine the OG flavor with the Train Wreck bud structure. The OG Kush mother brings medical benefits and a tasty, pronounced terpene profile. The Train Wreck father brings high commercial yields, resin production, and lemony scents. The sweetness in the Kandy Kush is courtesy of the OG Kush female and is where the name stems from. This plant is known for its high resin production and is stated to be one of the most resinous in the entire DNA Genetics catalogue. This strain took 1st at the Colorado Cannabis Crown 2010 for best medical cannabis out of 140 strains.

Once again, this strain can vary greatly in appearance depending on the specific phenotype. The shape can range from more oblong-shaped like the Train Wreck to more circular-shaped like the OG; however, they are all dense – a characteristic of both parents. Given the sativa influence of the Train Wreck, nearly all phenotypes will have orange pistils but coverage density will vary. Kandy Kush produces a thick coat of resin, thus buds will appear ‘frosty’.

While the variances in phenotype will apply to smell as well, Kandy Kush can generally be described as sweet, earthy, and piney. Some cuts will lean towards the OG Kush with distinct scents of sweet Pine Sol and lemons with a slight bite of fuel. Other cuts will lean towards the Train Wreck with scents of pine needles (herbal), flowers, and a slight bite of pepper. 

Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Although specific flavor profiles will vary, Kandy Kush generally has a sweet, piney, and pungent taste. The smoke is refreshing and keeps you coming back for more. Those growing from seed will have their choice of a variety of flavor profiles that can lean heavily towards one parent or the other. Those growing from clone should inquire as to the specifics of that particular cut.

Depending on the particular mix of indica to sativa, this hybrid strain can be effective as either a daytime or a nighttime smoke. For many users, the sativa influence of the Train Wreck can overpower the heavier effects of the OG Kush. In general, the effects can be described as uplifting, euphoric, relaxing, and mood enhancing. The sativa dominant strains will result in initially increased energy levels and focus. Kandy Kush is great from managing stress, pain, and depression.

A spectacular hybrid, this phenotype of Bubba Kush is exhilarating and motivating in comparison to most hardline indicas. Perhaps due to the detectable presence of OG Kush on the flavor pallet, it is a well-balanced strain with both sativa and indica effects.

OG Kush x West Coast Dawg x Old World Kush

From an indica dominant Chem Dog, a California breeder generarted a backcross, West Coast Dog, that was later gifted to Katsu, another breeder. That cut was bred to an old world Kush (South Asian landrace) and again to OG Kush. This is believed to be the original Bubba Kush (which some dispute).

Clustered calyxes like OG Kush with purple spikey water leaves that give the classic "Bubba" appeal. A bit more lenghty nodes and less golf-ball shaped than Pre '98 Bubba Kush.

            A hybrid in the truest sense, this combination of Airborne G-13 and selected Cinderella 99 males serves to increase the yield and flavor of the G-13 mother while retaining her legendary potency.  The flowering time of the two parent strains was already low, making this an especially attractive hybrid for growers with limited space, limited time, and the desire for top-flight potency.
        
            Airborne G-13 x Cinderella 99 mixed male pollen ("Evil Pineapple" pheno)
        
            The G-13 used in this cross is known as "Airborne G-13? and isn't the original cut, but is thought to perhaps be one of Neville Schoenmaker's original G-13 hybrids, likely the G-13 x Northern Lights #2.  There were 8 Cinderella-99 males used in a mixed pollination for maximum seed vigor and expression.
        
            Most of the smell comes from the Cinderella 99 side of the family, with its slightly putrid tropical fruit stank 

            The flavor is also mostly C-99, with a sour, sharp, and slightly sweet blend of fruity notes with hints of pine and skunk 

            Very potent to start, Killer Queen attacks the face, eyes, and forehead with a lot of fluctuating pressure.  Serving to awaken the senses, it takes the user on quite an energetic and cerebral ride, while mostly maintaining mental function throughout (except at higher dosages, as there is a high ceiling with this one).  As it begins to fade out, it takes on a more relaxing and G-13-dominant profile, both because it has positive body relaxation qualities and because it has a bit of the "sugar high" effect where the "Sativa up" amplifies the "Indica down" that follows. 

            Both genetic lines can take strong fertilization programs.  Depending on phenotype, training may be a suggested route — more G-13 dominant plants will form a strong single cola and stay short, while C99-dominant plants will be more Christmas tree-shaped and work well with training such as SCROG.

            Indica Dominat Hybrid
        
            Two of California's most famous strains meet the Netherlands' largest seed bank — King's Kush is the result. By combining the sweet and incense-heavy Grape Ape with the spice-citrus-skunk-fuel-funky OG Kush, Apothecary Genetics and Green House have created a stout and resinous plant with deep green leaves and a perfect mix of the parent strains in terms of bag appeal. The plant purples up easily later in flowering, even without cold temperatures.
        
            OG Kush x Grape Ape (Green House Seeds version)
        
            Apothecary Genetics out of California "reversed" and bred their Grape Ape mother with one of the many OG Kush cuts floating around the area, then hooked up with Green House Seeds in Amsterdam for mainstream distribution of seed stock.
        
            The smell really takes on a lot of the Grape Ape, bringing that grape-kissed musky incense sweetness it's most known for and receiving a boost of spice from the OG. 

            The OG is most prominent here, lending a spicy and somewhat aggressive flavor with a backing incense-heavy sweetness 

            The effects of this strain are exactly what one would expect given the parent strains — quality relaxation, mood elevation, and high levels of mental clarity. While both strains are potent, neither is potent to the point where functioning becomes difficult or sleep becomes inevitable — you can think and react but are simply more relaxed and positive while doing so. 

            This plant grows stout and has a strong central cola with moderate side branching. To maximize yield and reduce risk of mold, pruning some of the inner branches and leaves is suggested. Letting it go the maximum 9 weeks or a bit longer will allow for maximum resin development and flavor.

            Kronocaine delivers a typical haze buzz with a strong foundation in body relaxation from the Herijuana genetic lineage. The haze is strong, which is surprising to some because haze crosses sometimes don’t come out stellar. This is an exception, and when grown with enough flowering time to mature the cannabinoids and terpenes, can be a highly medicinal strain.
        
            Amnesia Haze x Herijuana
        
            Breeders Choice had success with Herijuana, an Afghani cross that provided solid indica effect and measurable, consistent yields. Revered as a highly medicinal strain in the United States, Herijuana, the male father plant of Kronocaine, has reputation for sedating and relaxing effects. The mother plant, Amnesia Haze, is known as a top-shelf sativa, bred for long flowering times and peppery, uplifting, motivational terpenes. After perfecting the Amnesia Haze, Breeders Choice crossed it with the stain they worked with before, Herijuana, to create a masterpiece hybrid. Kronocaine delivers a typical haze buzz with a strong foundation in body relaxation from the Herijuana genetic lineage. The haze is strong, which is surprising to some because haze crosses sometimes don’t come out stellar. This is an exception, and when grown with enough flowering time to mature the cannabinoids and terpenes, can be a highly medicinal strain.
        
            Bulky nugs for a haze varietal, Kronocaine still carries sativa qualities in the grow: Branchy colas that have spaced nodes and narrow leaves. However, the Afghani lineage gives some weight to the colas and allows clusters to form into sizeable dried buds.

            When two famous California genetic lines meet, the results can be wonderful, as seen in Kushage, which is a cross of T.H.Seeds' workhorse S.A.G.E. and Cali's famous OG Kush.  The resulting hybrid is a very uplifting and energetic Sativa with some of the OG relaxation present to mellow out the at times racy S.A.G.E.  This hybrid yields better than the OG, though the flowering time is slightly longer as well.
        
            OG Kush x S.A.G.E.
        
            Most Kushage we've tried has a rather sweet smell to it, taking more after certain phenotypes of the S.A.G.E. than the OG Kush.  Sweet, herby, with a hint of citrus. 

            Soft citrus, pine, and slightly floral elements form the main part of the flavor, again taking more after the S.A.G.E. than the OG Kush. 

            The Haze background of the S.A.G.E. comes through as the dominant effect, uplifting mood and stimulating the mind.  This is a great thinking strain, but not as great of a "doing" strain, as the mind can get lost on its travels easily.  The OG Kush side of the equation provides relaxing body waves and mental clarity later on in the duration once the initial potency passes.  This is a great daytime creative type of strain, though the comedown can be very draining and induce sleep.  It's recommended for energy, mood elevation, body relaxation, and for sleep as it fades away. 

            Kushage tends to grow into a sort of triangle shape, thinning out at the top as it progresses and forming an extremely dense and strong central cola if untopped.  It's advisable to prune the lowest side branches to encourage upper growth.  The plant will stretch up to 4-5 times in flowering when started at 1' or less, so allow plenty of headroom or train it heavily if the grow area is small.

Strawberry Cough has light, fluffy buds with light green calyxes and may be accompanied by more leaves than “kush” varieties. Strawberry Cough is in the skunk family and has the typical fluffy structure of many strains, like Blueberry.

Strawberry Cough has a musty, berry flavor that can be detected from the aroma of the buds.

Spicy and hashy, there is a light sweetness at times that brings to mind pressed hash 

This is a very relaxing and narcotic indica — even in smaller doses, most users will find themselves sinking into the couch with a smile on their face for quite a while.







At higher dosages, it's practically an express train to sleep — it's entertaining with the initial potency, but ultimately sedates and leads to deep relaxation.  This is a great strain for true Afghani-lovers — it's definitely more of an evening/late-night type of choice for most people. 

There are two standard phenotypes, one of which that grows an extremely strong central cola and the other which is a little branchier.  Both have dark indica leaves and can take heavy feeding, resist disease/mold, and work well in small quarters.  It's an easy-to-grow plant that is a good choice for beginners in any medium.

            A special and aggressive clone-only OG Kush, the LA Kush certainly came out of that area, tough not a ton else is known about its lineage. It seems to possibly have Diesel or ChemDawg crossed into it, because the smell is very sharp and fuely, unlike most of the more traditional OG Kush cuts such as San Fernando Valley, Ghost's OG, and Tahoe OG which have more of a spicy and citrus-pine quality to them. If anyone has more concrete information on the genetic background and history of this particular OG Kush cut (this cut is NOT Abusive's OG Kush, which took on the nickname "LA Kush" in the early-middle 2000's, but a different one), please contact us.

            We received a comment on an earlier L.A. Kush review indicating that this particular cut may have come from a grower named "Strainger" in the Orange County area, grown from a single bagseed.  This story is unconfirmed, but represents a possible piece of the puzzle.
        
            Very sharp and aggressive pine-heavy Kush scent, with strong hints of the "tire shop" rubber/fuel smell 

            The taste is just as aggressive as the smell, with slightly more citrus and fuel… very sharp, chemical, and acrid Kush 

            The aggressive" trend continues with the experience, starting off with a very strong package of head effects including lots of eye/face/temple pressure, racing thoughts, and a burst of energy. Despite the sheer potency of this strain, the mindstate is still predominately clear and it doesn't seem to inhibit mental function much at all.  This is a bit of an "extreme sport" type of strain that evens out in the second half of the duration, becoming a little more relaxing and like a typical OG. 

            This plant will produce long, slender, pointy colas with a fairly dense, large-calyxed structure and very fat trichome heads.

Available in feminized seed form only, this plant was made by crossing Barney's favorite in-house Skunk strain with a potent Mazar, resulting in a fairly heavy Indica plant that manages to retain some of the Sativa head effects from the Skunk.  A hearty plant that resists disease and mold, it definitely gets its structure and height from the Afghani side of its lineage rather than the Skunk, though it is also a good producer thanks to the hybrid vigor of the cross.

Mazar x Skunk #1

The Barney's Farm crew named the strain "L.S.D." after experiencing its potent and trippy effects.









A tangy lemon-lime musk is the standard smell, but at times there is a sweet, creamy, almost nutty aroma that comes out of certain phenotypes. 

It varies according to phenotype, but generally it's a slightly sweet musk with hints of citrus.  The taste is definitely dominated by the Afghani part of the lineage rather than the Skunk. 

Starting off with an increase in visual acuity and a strongly spacey mental state, this strain can seem like it's a Sativa early on, living up to the psychedelic namesake.  Once those initial effects passed, it still seems to stay mostly in the face but the body presence grows greatly as it progresses.  A creeping numbness and warmth enters the body, leaving the user able to get up and be active or simply sit and relax.  The end of the experience was more sedate and relaxing, bordering on tired-feeling.  This strain is recommended to intermediate users who want a little more adventure in their Indica relief. 

Grows well in any medium, grows to a fairly standard to short height and produces well for its size.

A legendary sativa popularized by the likes of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, Lamb's Bread (at times called "Lamb's Breath" or "Lambsbread") is thought to be a skunk variety but is wholly different, with an extremely uppy and creative sativa effect.

Jamaican sativa

The term "lamb's bread" is common in the Rastafarian religion, mentioned in many Reggae songs.  As a slang term, it's also common in Jamaica and simply means great ganja.  Dutch cannabis seed banks have taken to calling the strain "Lamb's Breath," erroneously thinking that it was Jamaican being pronounced "bread" or "bred."









Spicy, at times with a slightly putrid smell 

Spicy, but not particularly noteworthy 

This strain is an extremely uplifting and cerebral sativa, sparking the creative mind and making any daily activity more enjoyable.  This is a true tropical sativa and can come with feelings of anxiety and paranoia for some users, but for others, it's an amazing breath of fresh air mentally, clearing the cobwebs out and refreshing the perspective. 

Known for being grown outdoors, Lamb's Bread needs room to stretch if grown indoors.

Unknown, perhaps SFV x OG Kush, or Afghan x Thai genetics

Larry OG is a renowned cut of the famous, OG Kush. It’s origins are in California, along with many other strains in the OG family: Tahoe OG, San Fernando Valley OG, and Ghost OG. In fact, one theory of the history of OG Kush holds that all of these cuts originated from the original strain and perhaps a treasured family heirloom in the woods of Northern California, near Lake Tahoe. The controversy lies in the authenticity of strains. Yet another claim argues that OG Kush comes from Chem Dog (Chem Dawg) lineage. This would place OG Kush back on the East Coast in Massachusetts. Both of these stories may have a connection even deeper in history though. Chemdog, the breeder, received a couple ounces of spectacular high-grade “chronic” from a couple of Colorado deadheads at the Deer Creek Amphitheatre in Indiana, 1991. The Colorado guys called it “Dog Bud” or “Chem Weed”. Back then, strains didn’t have so many names as they did grades. This was premier cannabis that was different from many types. The Coloradans believe that the weed that chemdog got seeds from was from somewhere on the Oregon, California border. It’s not crazy to believe that the two varietals came from the same mother plant in Northern California. Chemdog ‘91, one of the originals that produced some bag seeds and distributed around the country, has been bred into most popular strains today: Girl Scout Cookies, Gorilla Glue #4, Bubba Kush, the list goes on. If there is an “American strain”, it’s OG Kush. In particular, Larry OG is thought to be the original cut. As a member of Overgrown.com, a since discontinued website under speculation of drug distribution, Handle: Larry” cultivated this cut of OG Kush.

Larry OG has bright green clusters of individual buds. In most indoor gardens, the buds don’t form grandiose colas but rather grow up several branches in small groupings with wide node space. Under natural outdoor conditions, OG Kush plants can form massive spherical bushes, resembling fruit or nut trees in less than 8 months

OG Kush has a strong musky, skunk aroma with hints of bleach cleaner and citrus. The conditions for which this strain is grown largely determine the strength of the aroma. Connoisseur shops can be distinguished from the rest by having several authentic OG strains with slightly varied terpene profiles.

To the trained tongue, OG kush flavor is unparalleled and unique among all cannabis varieties. The skunky chemical aroma transfers into flavor among vaporization or smoking and rests on the palate for minutes. Low-moisture flowers may produce a harsher smoke. OG Kush is best consumed nearly fresh after harvesting or with an extremely gradual dry time. Thus, OG is known for its stickiness. Some claim that the grow conditions in California produce superior quality OG Kush, akin to sourdough bread in San Francisco, or a true New York pizza crust.

            Super Skunk x Big Skunk Korean x Afghani Hawaiian
        
Bred by Soma to combine traits from international cannabis varieties and available in seed form.

Lavender is also known as "Soma #10? and comes out of a varied mix of genetic lines that span the globe. 

 The name comes from the finished color of the plant, the foliage of which often takes on deep purple, red, blue, and near-black colors before harvest.

The smell is much the same as the flavor, carrying a little bit of sweetness to go along with the incense-like, hashy notes. 

The bright colors don't really translate to the flavor, which is a spicy and incense-like taste which brings to mind certain varieties of hash, along with flowers, and vegetation. 

Soma's Lavender leans heavily towards its Afghani side in terms of effects, serving to deeply relax the user, creating a tranquil state of mind and deep body relaxation.

This strain fit very well into our daytime routines and pleased us with its distinctly floral elements which were present in both the aroma and flavor. We appreciated the cure and overall texture quite a bit, and it seemed to help the aroma stay present whether it was ground or sitting in the jar. The combination of relaxation and mental uplift this strain offers had us feeling positive but smoothly relaxed for upwards of 3 hours, making this a great strain to medicate with mid-day and feel relief until early evening. Definitely check out this one if you want a smooth Sativa that doesn't come with any real side effects or negatives.

Blue Dream variant (DJ Short's Blueberry x Santa Cruz Haze)

Spearhead-shaped fern green sepals arranged in loose open cluster calyxes, with bursts of fiery orange pistils, and above average coverage average-stemmed hooked trichomes with average heads

If you like a floral-spicy Haze type of aroma, this strain has that in spades. The name really makes sense once a whiff of the scent is detected, as it is ripe with flowery qualities and does bring to mind actual lavender. It's like the Blueberry side of the family took a vacation and left the Haze at home to play, though there is a slight sweetness (some described it as "purple, but not grapey") underlying the Haze elements. It's not the most pungent sample around, but it's definitely noticeable in the jar, and becomes nicely pungent once broken apart.

The flowery, almost soapy Haze elements from the aroma came through strongly in the flavor, though it wasn't quite as pleasing to our tastes as it was in aroma form for whatever reason. It has a light sweetness to it, but it was mostly present on the initial inhale, changing quickly to the more floral flavor that remained until the aftertaste. The smoke was light and crisp in the mouth, hitting smoothly and not really causing coughing except on some large hits. The final ash was a fluffy medium-light gray, showing it had received a proper flush.

This strain is somewhat unique in that it seemed to come on as more of an Indica to start, relaxing us and knocking us down a peg slightly, then transitioning into a more uplifting and Hazy effect after about 30 minutes. We felt that this one put us in a meditative state where we could function and work, but it carried a bit of signature Haze spaciness that had us walking around in circles at times, enjoying some of the psychoactivity it offered. The smooth effects peaked around 45 minutes, then gradually declined from there, lingering out to over 3 hours for most of our staff.

Lemons and a nutty, slightly vegetal quality (reminded one reviewer of almonds). There was a slightly putrid twang that came out after grind as well, a bit of "poo" smell.

Lemony, with a flowery finish that carried notes of peppermint and grass. The smoke was extremely smooth on the throat

An initial boost of energy was the main effect, but after about 30 minutes, the real potency arrived (definitely a creeper) and sent relaxation throughout the body and cast a bit of a haze over the mental proceedings. The eyes were burning a bit and sensitive to light, with an increase in internal pressure. Social interaction was pleasant and easy thanks to the elevated mood and mental energy. Later in the duration it became more relaxing and the head effects died down for the most part — a nice, soft drop back to normalcy.

A fairly tall and good-producing plant, Lemon Skunk is exactly what the name sounds like — a heavily citrus-tinged Skunk variety with a potent and relaxing effect.  It has the typical Skunk lime green buds and bright orange pistils, producing frosty, dense, spear-shaped colas.

Varies — some are two Skunks crossed, while others are Skunk x Citral

One of the Skunk strains involved in Lemon Skunk (for both companies) came from Las Vegas, Nevada and eventually made its way in some form or another to Amsterdam, where it became part of the breeding projects that produced the final strain.  Lemon Skunk also ended up in Green House Seeds' two-time Cannabis Cup Winner Super Lemon Haze.

Slightly sweet and mentholated lemon (many say "Lemon Pledge"), with a skunky backdrop.

Lightly sweet citrus with a floral element.

Though it's sativa-dominant, this is a rather relaxing strain that puts the mind and body at ease.  If let go long it can be a little hazy mentally, but normally it's rather functional, though mostly in more sedentary activities, especially after the first hour or so when it takes a more indica turn.  It comes with strong eye/face pressure fluctuations, aids with appetite, and helps with general relaxation, both mentally and physically.  

Lemon Skunk is a tall and fairly branchy plant whose side shoots can rival the cola in overall size and girth at times.  It responds fairly well to training and SCROG but most will yield pretty well without it.  Some heavy sativa plants will need to be staked, as flowering stretch can cause them to triple or quadruple in height.  It's known for having few leaves and being very easy to manicure as well.

Smelling uncannily like a fresh-cut mango, the creation of this strain was a matter of finding the fruitiest Mango and the most potent Sensi Star in the garden and crossing the two.  The result is a slightly Indica-dominant strain covered in the Sensi's signature layer of globe-headed trichomes combined with the smell and flavor of the Mango.

KC Brains Mango x Sensi Star

Like cutting a ripe mango under your nose with a knife — the smell of this one is truly incredible when properly dialed-in.  The slightly acrid smell that some mangoes have when cut is present as well as a wonderful background sweetness… one of the most uncanny fruit smells you'll encounter. 

The smell doesn't quite translate into the flavor fully, but there are still hints of the perfect mango taste (obscured by the taste of smoke and vegetation slightly). 

As the lineage would indicate, it's a slightly cerebral-feeling Indica experience that gains an extra mental punch from the Sensi Star in the early parts of the duration — the initial punch can be too much some some people, as it even affected equilibrium a bit.  It becomes relaxing on a base level and increasingly functional as the time went on though, with that initial blast of potency lasting about 45 minutes - 1 hour.  Recommended as a general relaxation med for the most part, some rather strong ocular attention, mild pain relief, and some sleep aid during the comedown. 

When skillfully soil-grown, the smell is absolutely amazing.

Nicely potent, and endured at medicinal levels for quite some time. Though it might be a little too sedate for a professional situation, the mental relaxation seemed able to be "shaken off" if required, leaving us fairly capable. This strain is recommended as an evening type of med for those who are seeking Indica-dominant relief from daily aches and pains… it's enough to relax after work but won't necessarily drag down your night or send you to bed unexpectedly.

Also referred to as SoCal Master Kush

Rounded olive drab closed cluster calyxes with saddle brown pistils, and short fat trichomes with large heads

This sample gave off a slightly skunky Kush scent, with a blend of piney citrus, spice, and a hint of fuel. It was nicely pungent both pre and post-grind, developing a bit of a fennel scent and some sweetness once disturbed.

Taste-wise, this one was a fairly spice-heavy Kush with hints of backing sweet citrus.

This strain started things off with some fairly strong head pressure and warmth, leaving the staff feeling rather medicated but cheerful and talkative. The warming body sensation was appreciated, as it started almost immediately and also ccontributed to the improved demeanor. After this initial period of uplift, this strain seemed to drop us down into a heavy state of relaxation where the core was heavy and warm but the limbs were mobile and active. Mentally it was fairly difficult to concentrate on tasks and this one was best left to the couch and evening relaxation.

This Master OG is perfect for an early evening relaxation, serving to ease both the mind and body while never feeling pushy or overwhelming. Though we would've liked more peak potency, it still had quite a bit of medicinal value, especially through the first 1.5 hours — but even past that, it left a lingering relaxation that aided sleep a great deal. Its appearance and smell were both above-average, though the smell was somewhat tame for a Kush, lacking some of the acrid notes that many of them have (which is a good thing for many people).

            Master Kush x Empress Kush
        
            Bred by Cabin Fever Seeds

Teardrop-shaped sage green calyxes with maroon pistils, and long thin-stalked trichomes with large heads

This OG had a fresh, sweet, perfumey, spicy, slightly fruity aroma that was easily noticed from several feet away but wasn't ever overbearing. After grinding, some sharpness came out and it increased in pungency further, releasing an aroma that had a rubbery sting that you often find in Diesel strains.

Much like the smell, the taste was on the light side of the OG spectrum, bringing more of a spicy and barely sweet taste that didn't carry any of the sharpness. It got rather smoky and nutty-tasting after the initial hits, but was never unpleasant. 

This was a rather smooth-feeling OG experience, coming on easily and slowly over the first 15 minutes. Other than the eyelids lowering and some redness, there were not many physical head effects to start — however, the body felt warm and relaxed despite the heart beating a little faster than normal initially. An elevated but not euphoric mood made us feel calm and productive when consumed in the daytime, very relaxed and ready for bed when consumed late at night. It lost a lot of its power at 1-1.5 hours, but though the overt effects died down, the mental and physical relaxation continued.

Fat foxtailed dark green calyxes with sienna pistils, and medium length and medium thickness stalked trichomes with large heads. Foxtailed dark green calyxes with sienna pistils, and medium length and medium thickness stalked trichomes with large heads

A bit piney, a bit earthy, but with a unique spicy smell that reminded us of fennel or even holiday spices. It wasn't very pungent until it was ground up.

Much like the smell, a pine taste was the dominant note, but there was also some lemon and a slight sweetness. It was expansive yet very smooth on the throat.

The back of the head began to feel heavy, but the eyes and forehead filled with pressure and a buzzing sensation, with the eyes in particular being heavily medicated to the point that they almost felt blurry. A very potent start for this strain, it took us to a state where the head effects were nearly overwhelming, sending one reviewer off for a nap.







Overall though, it was energetic in an even and non-rushy way, and felt capable mentally after the initial potency retreated. It also lightened the mood quite a bit, making us talkative and positive mentally. Very clean finish, it faded out without notice, lingering in the eyes for quite some time.

            Since the 1960's, "Maui Wowie" (or "Waui") was known as an especially exotic and desirable strain to cannabis connoisseurs the world over.  While it's unclear if the original genetic line is still alive and kicking, there are certainly many strains from Maui that are similar and capture the same smooth, citrus-pine taste and the enjoyable mid-level Sativa effects that it became famous for.  As far as the dispensary scene goes, it seems that Maui Wowie and "Maui" operate interchangeably for the most part, with some plain "Maui" being distinguished from the Wowie by a more Indica growth profile and effect (at times this is called Hawaiian Indica as well).  Maui strains are heavily Sativa in growth pattern, but the effect is generally mellow and clear-headed.
        
            Varies, the name is used for almost any Maui strain that made it out of Hawaii
        
            Originally popularized in the 1970's in pop culture by the likes of Cheech and Chong, Maui strains have retained an enduring reputation, especially with those who had it in its heyday.  Whether the original Maui Waui still exists is up for debate — most seed varieties are of murky lineage and are most likely hybridized rather than landrace Hawaiian seeds.
        
            Some Maui is very tropical-smelling, with hints of sweet fruits and a floral quality — others (the ones with a greater Indica influence) have a more pine-dominant profile and are less sweet.
        
            Again, there is some variation between the purer Sativa-dominant Maui and the pine-scented one — the pure Maui has a softly sweet flavor while the other one has a more earthy pine flavor with a hint of lemon.
        
            Though a well-grown and selected Maui may start rather strong, it generally will even out after 30-45 minutes into a smoothly energetic and uplifting experience.  Known for aiding creativity, it's also a good work strain once the initial potency passes, as mental processes are not affected and remain sharp.  Maui strains can sometimes border on rushy body-wise, and normally will give a vibrating body sensation — not one for really relieving pain, it's much more of a mental strain, providing aid with depression, anxiety, appetite stimulation, and migraines.
        
            Most Maui strains grow tall and lanky and may need support when flowering.  The seedbank varieties are often hybrids containing Indica genetic lines and produce very well for commercial pursuits, growing more stout and dense compared to the pure Maui lines.

            Mazar is known for being a rather heady Indica, thanks to the Skunk influence.  The effects really depend upon phenotype, as the Skunk-heavy pheno can simply feel like Skunk, with the typical mood-elevating, goofy, spacey effects.  The more standard pheno is still an Indica that works with a lighter hand, simply relaxing the body heavily and not forcing the user to sleep, but rather easing them into a deep sense of relaxation, both mentally and physically.   

            It normally grows into a stocky and non-branchy plant with a strong central cola, but there is also a more Christmas tree-like phenotype that takes more after the Skunk.

A 20:1 CBD rich strain with excellent medicinal properties. This strain has been demonstrated to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy, similar to Charlotte's Web. The lineage is rather unknown, but possibly a CBD-rich hemp phenotype.

Hemp plant CBD phenotype

Medicine Woman is a very vigorous sativa strain. Its origins come from a confidential CBD breeding project of which details are very limited. Because the plant grows and looks like hemp, many speculate that it was a high CBD hemp female that was pollinated with desirable traits to grow indoors.


A heavy CBD strain, and usually reserved for concentrates and extracts, Medicine Woman is recommended with those suffering from nerve pain or nerve disorders. CBD has also been demonstrated as an antioxidant and beneficial nutritional supplement. 

            Sativa
        
This sample was not overtly potent and felt smoothly enjoyable the entire time, only trending a little towards the drowsy towards the end, which normally works out well for a middle-evening medicating session. Mental Floss has a very unique bag appeal, with its strikingly colorful appearance and floral incense-meets-berry smell having us very excited to try it. The tiny seeds we found in areas were certainly disappointing, but didn't really seem to affect the smoking experience much, nor the look. The effects were perfect for an after-work uplift leading into early bedtime. We'd recommend this med to patients of any experience level, though it isn't quite top-level in terms of overall potency and duration. The unique aural effects this one had might make it particularly interesting to musicians or avid music listeners.

Bred by Chimera Seeds to be a large yielding strain with a pleasant aroma

Spearhead-shaped sepals in a range of greens from chalet green to dull avocado with eggplant accents, arranged in tight stacked calyxes, with bursts of moccaccino pistils, and above average coverage short thin-stemmed hooked trichomes with average heads

The aroma that this strain expressed was a blend of floral, sweet, and berry smells that mixed into a harmonious whole that we all enjoyed greatly. Once ground, it released a stronger incense-like aroma that seemed to be a magnification of the previous floral elements. Though it was nicely pungent right after being ground up and even in the jar, it dissipated quickly from there. Not an amazingly pungent smell, but it combined smells from the spicy/floral/incense area with the more standard sweet berry in a unique way.

The taste was a less distinct and pronounced version of the smell, with the same blend of floral and berry elements, but with a mentholated quality that almost seemed to make it less pungent. However, what flavor was there seemed to last for some time in the session, even as gray ash was beginning to form.

Coming on fairly quickly (within 5 minutes), the early effects of this strain felt heavily Sativa for sure, giving us a package of head effects including light pressure which felt like a buzzing "finger" poking into the forehead, and a general uplift in mental energy. Along with this came a definite uptick in heart rate and a light-feeling body that felt freed from many of the muscle aches and light pains of the day. Feeling capable and energetic, we found ourselves organizing things or simply enjoying the seemingly heightened sense of hearing, which had us picking up all manner of tiny sounds and processing them all at once. After the initial hour or so, the effects began to become much more relaxing, though the direct muscle relaxing quality that was present at first decreased in strength — the eyes felt dry and tired, increasing the tired feeling. We felt slightly lethargic at times, and overall, we found the comedown and later effects to be a little drowsy and typical of a Sativa "crash".

ChemDawg D x Tang Tang males

One of the most trichome-laden strains we've ever seen at KindReviews, Mob Boss (especially the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes) is absolutely covered with trichomes, from fan leaf stems to the tip of the large colas.  This distinctive appearance and very stout density makes its "bag appeal" off the charts for most patients, eliciting "wow"s from all but the most jaded connoisseurs.  When growing, the different phenotypes will be readily-apparent due to their differences in smell, but the Tang Tang-dominant phenotypes will be taller and will have a stronger, pointed central cola while the Chem D phenos will chunk up a bit more but stay shorter with rounded-top colas.









An herbal-citrus aroma is the predominant one before the strain is broken apart — the Tang Tang side of the family is not known for its scent. Once broken apart, it displays a hint of the sharpness from the Chem D, but is still largely vegetal and citrusy.  The Chem D-dominant phenotypes will have a much sharper aroma with elements of the notorious chemical-skunk-citrus funk of the mother, but the Tang Tang still tends to tone the whole  package down slightly from the original D.

Like the smell, it's not the most pungent thing around, tasting of herbal citrus with hashy notes in the background and a thick, expansive smoke.  Again, the Chem D phenotypes have a more assertive flavor and a lingering aftertaste of chem.

Thanks to the Tang Tang influence, this strain isn't nearly as heavy or overtly potent as the ChemDawg D, which is a good thing for many patients who still like to be productive during their day.  The couchy yet cerebral D influence is still felt though, especially in the second half of the experience (most strongly in the Chem-dominant phenotypes).  The Tang Tang phenos tend to be very clear-headed and smoothly uplifting, feeling like a moderate Sativa — the different expressions of this plant definitely deliver different effect packages.  Despite its absolutely ridiculous appearance, Tierra Rojo refers to this strain as a bit of a "show pony" in that it doesn't quite live up to the insane potency that the looks promise.  Still, it's above-average in potency and delivers a balanced effect which aids with muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and often gives a boost of energy as well (Tang Tang plants especially).

The Tang Tang adds vigor and yield to the Chem D and branches well, making this a superb plant for SCROG methods, as it will produce large colas on well-trained side branches and continues growing more dense into the final week.  This plant seems to give the best combination of yield and quality when grown in a coco-based medium and fed heavily — the trichome production displayed from week 3 on is astounding and the Mob Boss tends to look like the "whitest" plant in almost any room due to the fan leaves being caked with densely-packed thin-headed trichomes.  The Tang Tang phenos will have more pointed colas while the Chem D will be more rounded and blocky at the tops.

            Dinafem chose their two best clones of White Widow and Haze and crossed them, likely using the colloidial silver sex-reversal process in order to create male flowers on female plants, thus producing feminized seed stock.  White Widow is known for its power and trichome production, well Haze is renowned for its soaring, cerebral effect — combining the two produces a Sativa-dominant plant which ups the frostiness of the Haze, lessens the flowering time, but still retains much of the Haze flavor and aroma.
        
            White Widow x Haze
        
            Like a sweet Haze, carrying notes of flowers, citrus, vanilla, and tropical fruits — very appealing. 

            Flowery (even soapy), the Haze seems to come through more clearly in the flavor than the smell — it's not quite as sweet but still carries the same "smooth" qualities of vanilla and eucalyptus. 

            With a typical rush of Sativa effects starting things off (lots of eye/head/face pressure, a marked increase in heart rate), the Haze part of the equation announces itself quickly.  Very cerebral, even influencing vision a bit, this strain takes the user on a bit of a mental ride early on.  After the initial effects die off about 1 hour into the experience, it shifts gears, apparently bringing more of the White Widow influence to the table — a floaty, relaxed state that could easily lead into sleep finished things off.  This strain is recommended highly for its "up then down" experience as an evening med, as it will leave the user relaxed and ready for sleep after about 3 hours. 

            There are two common phenotypes in Moby Dick, one that is heavily Sativa-dominant and carries more of the spicy, floral, incense Haze taste and smell.  The other pheno has slightly more Indica influence and the final product is sweeter.  Dinafem recommends keeping the pH below 6.5 at all times to avoid iron deficiencies and keeping the EC around 1.5 - 2, as it it a rather heavy feeder and generally gets large.

            60 - 70 days
        
This hybrid stunned the world when it won the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam for the "Best Seed Company Sativa" after being entered by first-time competitor Rare Dankness Seeds. Moonshine Haze is a classic fusion of some of the best Hazes the Dutch scene has to offer with just a little bit of Cali genetics (the Trainwreck) to spice up the package. Its spear-shaped and pointed colas take after the Trainwreck, but otherwise it takes most strongly after the sweet Amnesia Haze, carrying slight elements of the reedy, slightly musky Neville's Haze as well. Many of the photos below were from a batch grown personally by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds and is from the same batch which won the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.

Soma's Amnesia Haze x Nevil's Wreck (E-32 Trainwreck x Neville's Haze)

Scott, master breeder for Rare Dankness Seeds said that this strain resulted from conversations with friends over the years about what a strain must have in order to win a Cannabis Cup.  Amsterdam is known for its love of Haze genetics, but it's also the place where the judges are perhaps most jaded on the holiest of holy strains Amsterdam has to offer. This lead to Scott creating the Moonshine Haze, using the wonderful workhorse Nevil's Wreck male to impart extra potency, trichome coverage, and aroma to the Amnesia Haze.







The strain was entered in the sativa category and High Times Senior Cultivation Editor Danny Danko announced it as the Seed Company Sativa 1st place winner, eliciting a "rebel yell" from Scott, who was in the audience nearby.  This award finished off what ended up being a sweep for Colorado genetics in Amsterdam for the Seed Company cups.

The nugs tend to be more pointed than rounded, and have a very strong and bold green coloration, with a classic look thanks to the bright orange pistils.  It has large calyxes for its lineage and gets a boost of trichome density from the Trainwreck which makes certain areas of the buds look almost gray at times (especially the underside of leaves).

The scent definitely seems to be Amnesia Haze-dominant, with a lightly citrusy, sweet, fresh aroma that is easily-noticed as soon as the jar is opened, though it's more of a "what's that lovely smell?" as opposed to "whew, what stinks?" situation.  When ground apart, its already strong pungency increases further, bringing out a slight sandalwood/spice haziness which adds complexity to the exceedingly pleasant, floral Amnesia smell.  This strain brings to mind several of the best things about Haze, and lovers of that genetic line will undoubtedly find something to their liking here.

Sweet and floral elements are most prevalent on the inhale, but the hint of citrus comes out on the exhale, leaving a lingering Haze note on the palate.  The smoke perfumes the smoke perfumes the room like most good Haze tends to do and is very smooth on the throat and not particularly expansive.

Starting off with a near-immediate boost of internal energy and a buzzing sensation throughout the head and body, this sativa definitely feels as such early on.  Mood is elevated, sensory perception seems heightened, and the mind becomes very active, if a little bit jumpy and frantic at times.  It's not a very "facial" strain, only providing a little bit of eye and face buzzing early in the duration, residing primarily in the brain instead.  After the stimulating initial effects have subsided a bit (normally around the 1 to 1.5 hour mark), it becomes a wonderfully care-free yet clear-headed sativa which doesn't drop mood or "crash" at the end, but rather keeps the user on an even mental keel and fully able to function.  This is a great daytime choice for stimulating the mind and body and generally improving the tone of the day.

Scott [at time of original print] primarily grows in a very regimented hydroponic setup, and these plants are no exception.  As they take a long time to flower, it's advisable to flip lighting to 12/12 when they're under 18 unless high ceilings are available.  The plant responds well to SCROG techniques and will form a large footprint rather easily due to the candelabra-like side branching imparted by the Trainwreck.

92 days for the Cup-winning phenotype

            Released to high acclaim, Mother's Finest is a very Hazey and Sativa-dominant strain effect, smell, and taste-wise, but still manages a short flowering time thanks to the addition of a secret unknown Indica with "maple leaf" traits.  The taste and smell seem to model themselves after the Jack Herer and/or Haze in most cases, giving off a spicy and lemony bouquet.
        
            Unknown hybrid containing Jack Herer, Haze, and an unknown Indica supposedly related to Juicy Fruit
        
            Mentholated citrus and pine with a spicy lean, very much like Jack Herer itself. 

            Much like the smell, it's a citrus-dominant Haze taste with some spicy pine elements and a mentholated, cool quality. 

            Very cerebral and spacey, this strain definitely calls upon its Haze lineage with its effects package.  Uplifting and somewhat energetic, it is a powerful strain that doesn't leave mental processes unscathed — some distraction and spacing out is inevitable with this one.  Lots of face and eye pressure occurs with this strain as well, making it appropriate for those suffering from ocular issues.  Once the cerebral Sativa start died down, it got slightly relaxing and more sedate towards the end, uplifting mood and making for a smooth ride back to a normal state. 

            Most phenotypes of this strain get rather tall and show Haze-dominant growth structure yet finish in a reasonable amount of time.  There are some Indica-dominant phenos that work well for SOG, but otherwise this is more of a SCROG type plant that responds reasonably well to training.

A heavy-hitting and hashy Indica hybrid that was intended to replicate the flavor and effects of the G-13 mother as closely as possible, Mr. Nice has deep green foliage and thick, dense buds.

G-13 x Hashplant

The strain was originally just called G-13 x Hashplant and was a limited release.  It was then re-created and re-released by Sensi Seeds and renamed "Mr Nice" after the nickname of Howard Marks, the famous cannabis and hashish smuggler, author, and advocate.

Slightly citrusy with a strong smell of trichomes (hashy) 

Earthy and hashy, with a spicy hint 

Strongly sedative, this strain is best for evening use.  Its rising body effect leaves the user feeling warm and vibrating, helping to ease muscle tension and pain.  Though not as strong as some modern day hybrids, this strain is a good choice for a moderate Indica user who likes a traditional hashy Afghani taste. 

Grows stout with a strong single cola and very dense buds, it's advisable to keep the humidity low to prevent mold in the main buds.  Good for SOG methods.

Here's the info from the man himself:

Arcata Trainwreck (original "E32? cut) x Nevil's Haze (Northern Lights #5 x Haze A) x Haze C

Created by Scott, founder of Stone Mountain Wellness in Longmont, CO

Flowering times range from 65 days to 115.  The quick finisher is a heavy blend of the two strains.  The longer flowering ones are most Nevil's Haze dominant.  My personal favorite pheno of this strain is the #12 female nicknamed the "Krumholtz Haze".  Krumhotlz is the low scrubby twisted vegetation found just above treeline before the alpine tundra — it is a piney, whorled twisted land of tiny trees and alpine flowers.  #12 earned the nick.  The heavy head feeling pheno you describe is the #14 aka Chunk's Haze.  Grows best in Hydro applications, gets BIG and yeilds heavy for a Sativa.

Flowers and spice with a bite to it 

Amazing flowery Haze taste with some pine elements 

Uplifting and highly energetic, this is a strain that makes you want to be active and be outside in nature.  One of the phenotypes has a somewhat strong Indica-like mental effect that makes the energy slightly less useful, but the rest tend to be almost entirely Sativa in effect. 

Grows extremely well in hydro and finishes out as a big producer for such a highly Sativa plant.

This strain is essentially adding more Indica influence to the Colorado Cough by backcrossing it to the Northern Lights #5 — that lineage could be seen in all parts of the experience we had. We never expected all that much from the flavor and smell of the strain for that reason, and that basically shook out the way we expected, with none of us really finding those elements remarkable. However, we all felt that the effects were superb, especially given that it outlasted most strains in terms of medicinal-level potency and overall duration. This is a perfect strain for a day off at home or an evening after a tiring day of work, serving to deeply relax the mind and body and relieve most pains. It didn't really elevate our mood, but put it us in a contemplative, at-ease state that would be conducive to activities such as yoga or meditation.

            Fort Collins Cough x Northern Lights #5
        
The Fort Collins Cough mother is a beloved Colorado clone-only strain Northern Lights #5 x Haze #17

Claw-shaped forest green sepals, arranged in loose open stacked calyxes, with sparse russet brown pistils, and above average coverage thin-stemmed wavy trichomes with larger than average heads

 While not a smell that will really impress anyone, this strain smelled much like we would expect, given the lineage. It was lightly citrusy, with a spicy, hashy background that increased in pungency when ground or broken up. It essentially smelled to us like Colorado Cough with less of the Haze qualities.

Like the smell, the flavor wasn't overtly pungent or noteworthy in terms of appeal. We got some lightly floral flavors that brought to mind hibiscus tea and some light citrus overtones, but otherwise it was mostly earthy and a bit smoky. One thing that we all liked about this strain is how smooth it was, never really making us cough due to either harshness or expansion — great choice for those who love a smooth smoking experience.

This was the area where this strain really shined, after a middling performance in the smell and taste areas. The initial effects of this strain came on strongly, but seemed to increase in potency further over the first 30 minutes or so. A "facial mask" pressure feeling, slightly reddened eyes, and what one reviewer referred to as a "glazing euphoria" overtook us, immediately taking hold of our mental focus and leaving us a bit detached from the world. The senses seemed open and aware, but the brain was a bit slow at handling the sensory inputs. Body-wise, there was a strong relaxation happening in the neck and shoulder area after the first hour especially, which served to kill off upper back pain and gave us a feeling similar to just coming out of a sauna. the slight mental stupor (it was described positively as a "meditative state") combined with the deep body relaxation made the second half of this experience superb for a quiet evening at home rather than out and about. A long, steady dwindle of effect left us ready for sleep by the end.

A veritable melting pot of genetic lines, this hybrid is as unpredictable as its lineage would indicate.  When finished, it produces dense spear-shaped nugs that glimmer with trichomes and bright orange pistils.

Blueberry x Northern Lights #5 x Trainwreck x BOGBubble

Giving off a not particularly noticeable piney scent in the container, it turns into a lovely lemony-fertilizer burst of freshness when broken into. 

Some lightly sweet lemon blends with oddly spicy juniper 

The effects of this strain are hard to pin down despite it being rather potent.  It starts out with a racy set of Sativa effects that brings to mind the Trainwreck part of its lineage — a racing heart, some perspiration, and lots of facial ad ocular pressure cycling.  Once that introductory state passed, it was a uniquely visual and cerebral experience, lending itself to solitary creative situations more than social ones.  To finish it often comes with a fairly heavy crash, leaving the user lethargic, heavy-eyed, and ready for bed.

A strongly Indica hybrid of two classic Amsterdam commercial hybrids, this strain was actually bred in Denver, Colorado.  Short-flowering and stocky, it will generally form a strong main cola if left untopped.  Both parent strains are known for being easy to grow and mold/pest-resistant, so this is a good beginner strain.

Northern Lights #5 x Ice

Floral, spicy, and lightly skunky 

Hints of grapefruit — piney citrus with a spicy bent and an earthy aftertaste 

A fairly strong starter, this strain is rather relaxing physically but also has quite a strong Skunk-influenced head effect.  It's not too potent to inhibit function, but it's definitely a nighttime type of strain due to its relaxing comedown, which leads easily into sleep.  It aids with muscle relaxation, gives a mood uplift, helps with minor pain, and increases appetite, making it a solid choice for patients who desire a relaxing Indica.

Would assume 50-55 days based on lineage

A stout, disease and mold-resistant plant with dark green, broad leaves, it seems apparent that Northern Lights is Afghani in origin.  There are several varieties of Northern Lights that worked their way into breeding stock for Sensi Seeds.  Northern Lights #1 is rare these days and was the taller and frostier selection with a fresh scent; Northern Lights #2 is more stout, piney-smelling, and very mite-resistant; Northern Lights #5 is the most popular, potent, and vigorous one; and Northern Lights #9 is a super-rare cut once held by Nevil Schoenmaker that was used to breed and then disappeared.
With its longstanding history and popularity, Northern Lights is in high-demand in most legal cannabis markets. Since it can be hard to come by at the dispensary, many home growers enjoy cultivating Northern Lights. Selecting the right marijuana seeds is important when cultivating Northern Lights and growers who want consistent results should look for feminized Northern Lights seeds to ensure a reliable harvest.

Thought to be of Afghani lineage, from the "Basic #5? line

See above — originated with the Super Sativa Seed Club, the earliest of the major seed banks.  It's since worked its way into hundreds of hybrids, making it one of the foundations of modern cannabis genetics.

Piney and earthy, at times lightly sweet 

Piney, hashy, and earthy 








Very relaxing and indica-dominant effect, at times able to induce sleep.  A heavy head, heavy eyelids, and a smile are the main effects of this strain, making it a great nighttime selection.

Grows well in hydro or soil, staying rather short and forming a single strong cola.  Great for SOG applications, it's also a low odor plant that's easy to grow for beginners thanks to its stature and disease/pest-resistance.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
The smell and taste for this one were absolutely top-notch — a great fusion of the two parent strains. We recommend this one as a daytime pick-me-up sort of med, as it provided good mental focus while making us feel very positive and relaxed. The initial potency was very strong, so inexperienced patients may want to take it easy at first.

OG Kush x ChemDog

One of the best pre-grind smell samples we've had, it's ridiculously pungent in the jar, broadcasting its acrid skunky-fuel essence all over the room. Once ground, the overall stank seemed to calm down slightly, unleashing more measured Kush notes (spice, soil, pine, citrus). It seemed ChemDog-dominant overall though, with strong notes of gun oil, glue, and other sharp, chemmy smells.

One of the best and most lastingly pungent tastes we've had in some time, this strain yielded a very strong chemical citrus attack, with some oddly flowery notes. The in-mouth taste was soil-heavy, with some citrus elements. On exhalation, a lingering aftertaste of gun oil and fuel complete this complex and pungent taste package.

Quickly the face feels pressure fluctuations, the eyes lower, and waves of energy are felt throughout the body — there was some "butterflies" feeling and a little heart-racing to start. After that passed, it felt fairly functional mentally, but the body was reluctant to do much more than enjoy a seat and it took on a fairly direct Indica quality. Even that initial wave of potency wasn't all that strong though, and this was a manageable medication overall, making it suitable for many situations, whether they be social, solitary, or a little of both.

Fairly sweet, where the kush was actually overpowered in this cross though still clearly evident. The scent stuck with this bud very well and was quite pleasant. 

Familiar piney kush flavor, nice but lacking in amount. A bit harsh with solid expansion.

Mixed bag of body and head kicking in 2-3 minutes after ingestion. An immediate wobbly head sensation and medicinal concentration in the temples and rear lobes. By 10 minutes the body was relaxing, the mind was slowing, and tasks were becoming projects. Characterized as an indica relaxation with just enough sativa (energy/focus) to make chores or work performable though not preferrable.

Oh! Zone looks extremely Indica in almost every way, from the dark coloration to the fat trichome heads, and the taste and smell carried that trend through, with a package of spicy, musky, and earthy qualities. We felt that the effects seemed to depend upon context a bit, as a morning review produced more of a moderate Indica hybrid experience, and a later session resulted in a more overt Indica feeling, with only the first 30 minutes to 1 hour feeling energizing or stimulating. The sleep aid properties that ended this experience were perhaps its greatest medical benefit, but the main effects serves to elevate mood a bit while helping with daily aches and tensions. Oh! Zone had a potent start that might be a little much for inexperienced patients, so we'd mark this in the mid-level patient category, primarily for evening use.

            UBC Chemo x OG Kush
        
Bred by Canada's Doctor Greenthumb Seeds

Arrowhead-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight stacked calyxes, snaked with shocks of rust colored pistils, and above average coverage with short thin-stemmed trichomes with large heads.

Though this isn't an appealing smell in the sense that something fruity or sweet is, it appealed to the Indica-lovers in our staff, who recognized the musky, woody, spicy, earthy aromas it released as harbingers of a traditional type of Indica experience. It was a bit softer and more straight musky with slight pepper notes in the bag/jar, but when ground, it became sharper and a tad garlicky, with hints of pine and a major uptick in pungency level.

Much like the pre-grind smell, the flavor was a spicy, vegetal, and earth-dominant experience, never tasting particularly distinct. The smoke was fairly pleasant and only made us cough on large hits due to expansion. The flavor did degrade to the point where it wasn't pleasurable by the end, but that's fairly standard amongst strains that aren't overtly flavorful from the outset. 

The initial effects of this strain, like many, seemed fairly Sativa in nature, serving to awaken us quite a bit just by changing the mental state slightly and causing physical effects in the head, face, and eyes along with the urge to move around in the seat or get up and walk around. We got some typical pressure increase in the facial areas as well as a cascading/waving body effect that was mostly concentrated in the neck, shoulders, and upper torso. An increased heartrate and some spatial distortion had us slightly overwhelmed at times early on, but that cleared up after about 30 minutes. The early energized effect evened out into a relaxing but somewhat cloudy-feeling mental state, where tasks could be accomplished, but tended to move more slowly and deliberately than normal. One reviewer amongst our group who reviewed in the morning hours found it to be not nearly as heavy, and the initial effects seemed to carry the energy level into the 2nd hour — the rest of us had a more short-lived "up" part of the experience. Relaxation builds after the first 1.5 hours or so, culminating in an outright sleepy state as it left us.

Bred by Obsoul33t, a master sure to leave his mark on both the underground his moniker reminds you of and the industry sure to produce copious amounts of his flower, the OJ Ghost stems from a pack of seeds gifted in Gaberville, CA in 1988.  One lone male was found...and we thank our lucky stars it was bred to multiple elite clone-only strains.  This particular cross is with Ghost's OG Kush, one of the orginal OG's known for being one of the best illustrations of the OG hybrid nature, and one of KindReviews' all-time favorite cannabis varietals.

The dry bud is very conical in nature with medium to small calyx/sepal size.  The pistils tend to brown quickly and easily and assist in adding a rust color to the generally orange hue of the flower.  The OG side of the plant offers a distinct lime green coloration to the flower as well as the tendency to go slight purple and other darker hues while in late flower prior to harvest.  She is a beautiful plant and can easily be picked out of a garden, or at least isolated to the family of OJB ladies.

As with all of the OJB crosses, the orange peel aroma is absolutely demonstrative!  Unlike the familiar Tangerine Haze and Tangie lines which have softer, muted orange (citrus) scents, this family line brings childhood soccer game orange peel smells right to your face.

Upon intial inhale or dry puff the orange dominance makes its mark, but exhale of the smoke leaves a wonderful OG pinene flavor across the tongue and roof of mouth.

The general nature of the high is quite similar to the mild mannered OG Kush line (not the heavier handed and indica dominant varieties like Skywalker OG, Hells Angels OG or even Face-Off OG) with a clear pep towards the euphoric sativa side of things thanks to the OJB terpene profile.  While clearly not a skyrocketing sativa by any stretch, the OJ Ghost has an uplifting attitude beyond the OG family that can be appreciated any time of day.

            Orange Juice Bud x Legend OG
        
Bred by Obsoul33t, a master sure to leave his mark on both the underground his moniker remnds you of and the industry sure to produce copious amounts of his flower, the OJ Legend stems from a pack of seeds gifted in Gaberville, CA in 1988.  One lone male was found...and we thank our lucky stars it was bred to multiple elite clone-only strains.  This particular cross is with Legend OG, one of the heavier OG Kush varietals.

While still possessing the OJB male qualities, the OJ Legend brings more of the traditional OG pinene funk and chemical palette to bare.

The OJ Legend is a bit heavier than the OJ Ghost, and certainly more so than the OJ Diesel.  The samples we've had the opportunity to test leave us feeling the OJ Legend (this pheno at least) is the more OG dominant side of the family, with less OJB terpene effect on the mood and euphoria side of things.  This is a good solid OG hybrid body stone, with a fruity taste as opposed to a cross that has changed the overall characteristic of an OG high.  It reminds us of adding a citrus peel to a really well-crafted pale ale, it's just a tinge of extra flavor (or attitude), not a wholesale change of beer style.

The appearance was fairly spectacular thanks to the eminently visible trichomes that lay all over the bud surface. The smell/taste package was average but enjoyable enough not to hamper anything. The real star here though are the effects, which were blindingly potent at first, but dropped off to a very useful state of focused functionality. Some body attributes were present later on in the duration, but overall, this was a "heady" med that is best-suited for mental energy, mood, and ocular relief.

Island Sweet Skunk x Trinity

Fat spade-shaped olivine sepals, arranged in stacked spiral calyxes, with frequent bursts of copper pistils, and above average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large heads

Not exactly appealing in the sense that you want to smell it regularly, this strain was a combination of a slightly creamy vegetal sweetness along with a more putrid, fecal, "cheese" type of smell that made us wrinkle our collective nose. It hints at potency, but isn't terribly appealing to most people. The smell also weirdly seemed to disappear after a grinding rather than getting stronger.

Much like the smell, the taste wasn't terribly appealing but wasn't bad either — it gave off a light, spicy citrus with some smooth, almost creamy notes present along with a floral (one reviewer said "soapy") quality. Contrary to many strains, this one seemed to taste better when you really go at it with the lighter rather than 'sipping' it, filling the mouth with a floral-tinged smoke.

A very heavy and nearly overwhelming Sativa experience started this one off — the brow sweated, the heart rate jumped, and a rising pressure filled the brow/forehead/eye area. Mentally it had us full of energy but a bit spaced-out, at least initially. The initial potency only lasted about 30 minutes (probably a good thing, it was a little much even for our veteran review staff), fading into a focused state where we found ourselves swept up in a single task that seemed to go on unabated for hours. Though not exactly couchlocked, that was basically the end result, as the singular focus on sedentary work/activities kept us engaged throughout. Some enduring head pressure was the last physical remnant of this med, and it faded out cleanly with only a little bit of a drained feeling.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
We really enjoyed this sample after not being overly excited to try it based on our experiences with Mango and its family in the past, as well as the reputation of Nirvana Seeds for putting out variations on other seedbank product. However, this particular Papaya really impressed us with its strong and lasting Indica-dominant effects which had us glued to the couch, but enjoying every minute of it. The musky and complex fruit smell and flavor really reminded us of Mango at times, and that added to the overall appeal.

            Citral x Ice
        
Bred by Nirvana Seeds to be a fast growing and disease resistant strain.

Claw-shaped cucumber green sepals, arranged in tight cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of paarl brown pistils, and average coverage with short wavy trichomes with large heads

This strain had a fruity and slightly musky smell to it which did indeed bring to mind mangoes, down to the complex-smelling skin with its musky qualities, which seemed to mostly be present pre-grind. Once it was ground, it took on a more directly sweet and floral fruity quality, keeping the mango scent mostly intact. This was a rather uncanny-smelling fruit strain, and one that impressed us, given that we had not really heard much about it in the past.

Lightly sweet and fruity, the flavor was similar to the smell, but not quite as directly fruity, with more of an earthy bent on the inhale, converting to an almost peppery, spicy funk on the exhale. This complex-tasting strain certainly had tropical fruit elements, but it was mostly reminiscent of the earthy, spicy, and lightly fruity Afghani lines. The flavor was pleasantly sweet until mid-way though the bowl, but the smoke was also rather thick and expansive, causing some coughing at times.

Though we did feel some Sativa effects such as a major increase in heart rate, this sample felt heavily Indica, though it was nicely functional at smaller dosages. The initial potency seemed to last a long time, keeping up at a high level through 1.5 hours, mostly putting us in a couchlocked state where the body literally felt heavy and pulled down but the mind was fairly active and engaged when prompted. Strong pain relief and muscle relaxation had our bodies feeling rather floppy and the waves emanating from the solar plexus kept up at a high level for almost an hour. A lasting euphoric feeling was the main mental effect we experienced, and we just generally felt very good the entire time we were medicated on this strain. As the effects cleared, we lifted ourselves off of the couch and regained some of our ability to focus, and there were no real lingering tired feeling or other negative side effects.

Bred and released by the GDP Crew out of California, the exact genetics are a bit hazy online.  Many of the seedbanks have it clearly listed as simply the Cherry Pie x GDP but forums dating back to the original list have additional Platinum Cookies or Bay Cookies in the mix.

Dark purple and even black leaves adorn this plant in flower. The flowers themselves closely resemble the GDP in size and structure with even more densly packed resin glands cover the plant from top to bottom.

Very dark grape, some over ripe fruit tones of the red nature (apple/cranberry/cherry) present on the dried and cured flower.

While it is hailed as a cookie dough tasting strain, we've never encountered that taste at all.  Rather, we find this to be a darker, earthier version of a GDP strain with some smokey wood and nut notes present.

Heavy indica body high, a traditional "stone" feeling that lasts for a solid 2+ hours.  No crash, and no ceiling found among our numerous encounters.

We wish we knew the origins of this strain so that we could better see where its potential lies medically — this one just seemed like it wasn't quite what it could be, and making judgments on the strain as a whole would be difficult. We saw huge potential in the smell/flavor package, which reminded us of some of our favorite fruity Hazes — but the iffy trim, overall "blah" visual appearance, and lack of visual trichomes knocked it down a peg. The effects were definitely Sativa-dominant, with a familiar Haze-influenced dream-like effect and some moderate muscle and mental relaxation. We sort of vacillated between active and sedative states, making the medical uses once again a little confusing and varied. We see this as a late daytime type of med for patients who want to retain functionality and energy but can still use a mental vacation.

Unknown

Long, thin spearhead shaped palm green calyxes, formed in loose closed clusters, with dark goldenrod pistils, and above average density of average-stalked trichomes with small heads

This strain really reminded our crew of something from the Jack Herer line, as it had that familiar (yet sweeter, more in the Jack Flash vein) citrus Haze aroma that we all love — another reviewer mentioned Dutch Durban as another similar aroma profile. It was certainly noticeable in the jar, but it really developed when it was handled or ground up, getting a little more aggressive and taking on an almost Diesel-like backing musk that competed with the sweetness for attention.

Giving off a rather thick smoke, this strain mostly matched its aroma in the flavor, bringing a slightly more floral, eucalyptus-influenced flavor with many of the same citrus elements. It left a pleasantly hashy aftertaste in the mouth, and the actual flavor maintained well as it burned away. As mentioned, the smoke was rather thick, moderately harsh, and rather expansive — in short, you'll probably cough on this one from one or the other.

About 5 minutes following the start of the review session, the typically Sativa onset of a buzzing body and changes in head/eye/face pressure set the tone for the majority of the experience. Our heads felt light and floaty, even a little disoriented or dizzy at times, while our bodies were lightly energized, buzzing strongly in the upper legs, forearms, and ears. A familiar Haze-influenced "sensory blanket" seemed to have us a little bit duller and slower than normal in a variety of mental processes, though the mood elevation it provided made us not particularly care. As it moved on, our bodies became more relaxed and it moved into the standard Sativa comedown, where the couch is more attractive than movement… this state seemed to go away and come back several times over the final 1.5 hours.

The smell this strain possessed was pretty wonderful — basically the opposite end of most of the impressive-smelling samples we've had lately (most seem to be Diesel or Kush-dominant), it provided a wonderfully sweet candy-like aroma that still had a nice sharp quality to it. The appearance was very good as well, with lots of colors and great structure. Though the cannabinoid numbers came back kind of low, the initial potency actually felt rather strong and this strain held steady at medicinal levels for a solid 1.5 - 2 hours, which is very good. It might get on top of you a bit when it shifts gears mid-way through and gets heavy on the eyes, but the worst thing that would happen is an unexpected nap. We recommend this as a very good after-work relaxation med or one that leads into sleep; it was a quality Indica-dominant hybrid experience overall.

Pezz x Sour Pink Grapefruit

A rare clone only, the parents are a Pezz clone held by Apothecary Genetics in California and a Sour Pink Grapefruit male from Hortilab seeds

Claw-shaped rain forest green open calyxes with maroon pistils, and long, thin stalked trichomes with medium heads

This was the only area where the name really seemed to fit the strain — the smell it produced reminded us of a sweet pink grapefruit. There were notes of citrus, pine, cherry candy, and flowers, and it was nicely pungent once ground up.

While it wasn't a bad taste, we really struggled to get much of a read on this one. We got some sweet notes, some slightly spicy/floral notes, and that was about it. The smoke was smooth and enjoyable though, very easy to consume with it non-expansive nature and soft attack.

The Pink Pez started out with a Sativa-feeling head attack, making our foreheads feel heavy and overbearing, as if we had a Neanderthal brow. The initial attack made it a bit hard to focus and there was a clear heart-racing that came on about 10 minutes into it, building in effect until its peak around 30 minutes. Though it was fairly social in nature, we think it would be a bit of a struggle to have a complex conversation with a stranger, etc. — best for easy-going company. A heavy body presence came over us after the initial effects receded — we felt relaxed and drawn to the couch… this stage could easily lead into sleep. Depending on the time of medication, you'll either shake yourself off and continue on with your day once this med brings you back to normal. or you'll be tired enough to just call it an early night.

LA Kush x Tang Tang

The Pootie Tang strain was created in 2012 by New House Seed Co. – a joint venture between Tierra Rojo and Paco, two Colorado based growers. The strain is a cross between LA Kush, an indica dominant hybrid known for its relaxing and euphoric properties, and Tang Tang, a racy sativa strain derived from a Blue Sonja backcross. The strain is prevalent in Colorado but can be difficult to find in other states. Pootie Tang won 3rd place at the 2015 Denver Cannabis Cup for best sativa flower.









Because this strain is available from both seed and clone, there are a variety of phenotypes floating around. Pootie Tang can take on an appearance that leans towards either one of the parents; however, the Tang Tang influence seems to be more pronounced. The Tang Tang parent brings sativa plant structure with elongated node structure, intense trichome coverage, and large fox-tailing colas. The clone-only LA Kush parent contributes bud density and a slightly darker green bud color. The sample we tested resembled the Tang Tang as opposed to the OG structure one might expect from the LA Kush influence.

The variations in phenotype will also result in variations in smell. However, Pootie Tang can generally be described as earthy, hashy, and tangy. The smell is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with the aroma of each of the parents. The underlying tangy-ness is a mild citrus smell – like a fresh grapefruit as opposed to a ripe orange.

Once again, flavor will vary between phenotypes; however, the taste can generally be described as dry, musty and slightly refreshing. The taste is predominantly earthy, which is consistent with both parents. The refreshing flavors can range from tangy (from the Tang Tang) to more piney (from the LA Kush). Despite the name, do not expect the flavor to be intensely ‘orange.'

The powerful sativa qualities of the Tang Tang seem to make their way into nearly every Pootie Tang phenotype. Pootie Tang induces a strong head high with the classic frontal lobe sativa buzz. This strain can be somewhat of a ‘creeper’ with delayed effects that continue to increase in intensity over time. The LA Kush balances out the racy nature of the Tang Tang high. Overall, Pootie Tang induces a classic stoney sativa sensation that is concentrated in the head.

 It is perfect for high-elevation, low-water landscapes like its home in the Hindu Valley, Pakistan.

Thick settled purple- almost black- water leaves are shaved to the edge of the dense bulbs giving a unique cut. The flower manicurist can pass gently over the harvest but must maintain that the broad-end spiky tips be removed to condense the potency for the smoker.

            Though it's a Sativa plant, the effects from Presidential Kush are more Indica in nature aside from the first 45 minutes or so.  Those initial effects include a large amount of head and eye pressure fluctuations, a light, floaty body, and an immediate elevation in mood.  As it progresses, the feeling becomes more sedate, warming the body and carrying moments of euphoria at times.  After the 'down' second half, the return to sobriety is a lift in energy.  This strain is good for anxiety, mood elevation, body relaxation, sleep aid at higher doses, and appetite stimulation.

L.A. Pure Kush x Appalachia

Pura Vida is a serious THC heavyweight. Some test results of cured and dried Pura Vida flower have yielded 26% THCa by weight. Thus, it is renowned by cannabis extract enthusiasts for its high concentrate yield. Beyond cannabinoids, Pura Vida has pungent Afghan Kush terpene profile, full of beta and alpha pinene. Held in high regard by severe pain medical cannabis patients, many describe that heavy terpenes and THC in Pura Vida deliver an analgesic, numbing feeling when consumed. The Appalachia is apparent with chemy skunkiness while the Pure Kush lineage delivers even more aroma and powerful cannabinoids.









A dense coating of Trichomes is apparent on finished buds. Drying with consistency, each flower looks as though it was neatly manicured, though the dried flowers don’t need much trimming at all. Pura Vida produces medium sized colas that spiral up branches while growing which makes it perfect for hang-drying and slow curing.

Pura Vida has a nearly offensive-strength terpenes and produces heavy pine, skunk and lemon aromas. Fresh flowers have a more chemy sting to the nose and as the flower dries the skunk and lemon become more dominant.

Pura Vida produces a thick and rich smoke. Whichever way you prefer to consume cannabis, Pura Vida delivers. Because of its high yield, this flower is prevalent in many concentrates to boost cannabinoids while not compromising any flavor or aroma. A tightly rolled joint may deliver flavor nuances of citrus fruit, pine forest and hopps.

            Pink Champagne x Grand Daddy Purple
        
            Purple Champagne is a combination of Pink Champagne and Grand Daddy Purple. Although it is described as a hybrid, some users (and growers) describe it as sativa dominant, as the Grand Daddy Purple used in the breeding of the Purple Champagne is a rare sativa dominant phenotype. Also called Phantom, Pink Champagne is a highly medicinal indica hybrid, and thought to have originated from Cherry Pie and perhaps Grand Daddy Purple.
        
            Clustered yet firm and dense buds are typical of Purple Champagne phenotypes, ranging in color from light pink to forest green. The flowers are not consistently purple, like many GDP strains, like Grape Ape, yet the nugs carry marbled purple hues throughout.
        
            True to the name of Champagne, the buds smell a bit acidic yet fruity like wine. The finished buds carry a hoppy mustiness as well. Some phenotypes exhibit more pine and juniper than others which are more fruity.
        
            Purple Champagne has a heavy smoke that saturates the mouth in a tingly, heated smoke. Some users may prefer to try Purple Champagne in concentrate form. In cannabis extracts, the linalool and myrcene terpene content dominates and may provide a stress-reducing yet uplifting high.

Purple Dragon is a very interesting purple strain, as it lacks many of the trademarks aside from the color and taste. Instead of an almost narcotic or "druggy" feeling that some purples create, this one was nicely clear and motivated while still carrying the medicinal qualities that cause many patients to seek out purple strains. Purple Dragon is a superb choice for those patients who desire pain and tension relief while not feeling (or looking) drugged up or lazy as is often the case with purple strains.

Northern California clone scene cut that is possibly a "selfed" Purple Urkle with Sativa traits, or Blue Dragon x Urkle

A very pretty purple strain that looked nicer than some others we've seen, with a typical purple in its color palette.  It was basically perfect texture-wise and was above-average in trichome coverage 

A very stinky and musky example of a Purple strain… the pungent musk carries notes of "dark" fruits like plums and grapes, which really came out after the grind.  In the jar it's got a nice skunkiness to it as well that adds to the pungency… an impressive bouquet overall, though a little on the "impressive but not exactly pleasurable" side due to the strong musk factor

An almost cotton candy/bubble gum purple sweetness 

Definitely strong in Sativa qualities for a purple strain, this one was almost buzzy and energetic throughout the body and behind the eyes.  That subsided fairly quickly though and turned into more of a passive pain relief quality, where one reviewer with back issues was able to work in the garden for nearly 2 hours with no pain to speak of, even after having spasms that morning.  Though it provided quality relief, it didn't possess much of an actual body feeling (i.e. buzzing, pulsing, warmth), which was a little unique.  It also seemed to have almost no effect on cognition… totally clear-headed and aware, which again is unusual for a purple strain.

Everything you want in a classic Blue Dream with the added bonus of a deep purple hue that gives a gentle indica finish to a well-balanced sativa experience. Overall, Purple Dream appears like any other thin leaved equatorial cannabis varietal until mid to late flower when it starts taking on beautiful purple pastel hues and gains its signature fake grape candy scent.

Purple #1 x Blue Dream

The dried flowers are very light purple, almost a water color version of lavendar.  the contrast to orange pistils is stark and the overall bud structure is mid to whispy, while the size is medium to large.

The aroma is one of a kind, with very sweet notes mixed with synthetic purple candies.  The hazey nature comes through with a bit of sharp spice reminding you this really does carry the Blue Dream family line very well.

Spicy haze is the dominant flavor, though if smoked through fresh glass plenty of the aromatic fruitfulness will strike the back of the tongue.

Not as heady as a classic Blue Dream, the Purple #1 evident in its genetics lends users a relaxed, less motivating high while still delivering creative thoughts and uplifting attitude.

            An exceedingly short, squat plant that seems to turn purple at any time of the year.  Fat leaves and small stature with the dark coloration characteristic of the true Afghani/Pakistani landrace varieties.
        
            Believed to be a pure landrace Pakistani/Afghani variety
        
            Not much is known about this particular plant except that it likely came out of Afghanistan/Pakistan during the 80's when the country was in upheaval, and was likely brought to the USA by American military personnel.  It is thought by many to be the mother plant to the modern Purple lines such as Grape Ape, Granddaddy Purple, Purple Urkle, etc. This cut is also thought to be the same cut as the Pacific Northwest's "Ultraviolet".
        
            Perfumed grape incense-like smell. 

            Nearly identical to the smell, it's a perfumed grape-heavy smell that brings to mind incense and flowers. 

            Relaxing and semi-narcotic like most Purple strains, it's clear that this one is 100% Indica.  Good for pain relief, relaxation, anti-anxiety, and sleep aid. 

            Purple Indica is a tiny, squat plant that will need additional vegetative growth time to get weight.  It also requires a lot of pruning close to the stem to prevent bud rot.

The SR-71 cut is thought to be a very similar to Purple Urkle (possibly a hybrid) and has more of the typical "purple"/hashy grape flavor — it was passed most commonly by the SR-71 (now Blue Sky) Coffeeshop in the "Oaksterdam" section of Oakland, CA and may be Purple Afghani x Hindu Kush.  The Garberville Purple Kush is most notably held by Swerve of Cali Connection Seeds fame and tends to grow with some foxtails and has more of a straight-up Kush taste/smell with hints of the "purple".  Kyle Kushman's Las Vegas Purple Kush was claimed in a New Yorker article to be a special Purple Indica x Northern Lights find, but many have since claimed it's an S1 Bubba Kush of some kind due to the dark flavors present.  And finally, many old-school people claim that none of the famous clone-only PK's around are in fact the original Purple Kush, which is said to be a very special Purple Pakistani variety that was found in the late 70's or early 80's.  As you can see, the history of a strain that's been renamed several times and has several legit versions floating around gets very murky quickly.









Purple Afghani x Hindu Kush (one version — see description for more info)

See above.  The SR-71 cut was originally named "Ultraviolet" by its original grower in Oakland, CA (credited as "K" from Trichome Technologies according to SR71's catalog).

Pungent, with notes of "purple" (incense, perfume, musky grapes), and the spicy Kush end of the spectrum as well.  The SR-71 and Garberville cuts are more "purple" in both flavor and smell compared to the Kyle Kushman/Las Vegas Purple Kush. 

Much like the smell, the flavor is a dark fruity musk with a bit of sweetness at times — a great blend of the typical purple flavor and traditional Afghani/Pakistani Kush varieties. 

Eminently relaxing and rather potent, Purple Kush is definitely in touch with its Afghani-Pakistani roots.  Coming on with a slight rush of energy, that subsides quickly and leaves the user with a floaty, highly medicated body experience that makes aches and pains as well as anxiety/stress melt away.  Purple Kush is also known for being a long-laster, normally going out to the 3 hour mark.  Recommended highly for body pain, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and sleep aid at higher dosages. 

Grows well in soil or hydro — they all have fairly strong yield considering the possible Urkle lineage and traditionally slow vegetative growth of purple strains.  Cooler temperatures at night and a longer flowering time will help to bring out the purple coloration to a higher degree.

            A California medical scene cut that is dated back to the late 1980's, the Urkle (also called Purple Urple, and Purple Urkel) is thought to have come from the Mendo Purps line.  It's a slow-vegging plant that almost always turns a deep shade of purple by the time it's finished. It's the purple plant of choice for many, as it's known for being more potent and flavorful than many of the others.
        
            Thought to be a phenotype of Mendocino Purps
        
            Purple Urkle is thought to be an inbred line dating back to at least 1989, possibly quite a bit earlier.  Its origins are thought to be that of a pure Indica, likely coming from Afghanistan or Pakistan.  It made its way into the NorCal medical clubs in the mid-90's and has been going strong ever since, being crossed into a wide variety of strains due to its unmistakable coloration, smell, and overall stability.

            Spicy, sweet, and pungent in its ideal form, at times it's simply earthy with a hint of incense. 

            Not like a normal Purple strain in that the Sativa influence takes the edge off of the normally narcotic qualities of the Purple family.  To start, it actually feels rather Sativa in nature, starting strongly with a package of head pressure fluctuations and a slightly excited, floaty body.  The second half gets more sedate and relaxing on a base level, trending towards couchlock and even aiding sleep at higher dosages and depending on context.  Appetite stimulation was a big part of this strain, and it otherwise provided a solid hybrid relaxation, both mentally and physically.

This "purple" was better than many in that it didn't leave us feeling totally groggy and sleepy, but rather had a fairly clear-headed feeling for the majority of the effects. Some of the typical Purple taste combined with a strong Afghani influence made this an average medicine in terms of taste and smell, but the duration and effects mostly made up for it. We would recommend this strain for an indoors nighttime activity or work, as we were functional but not exactly full of energy — it would put you in an appropriate mental state for sleeping as well by the end of the effects if consumed in the evening.

Sweet dark florals and grape candy over an earthy musk

Musky dark fruits, currant, bitter grape

Dull and immediately medicated eyes were the first effect felt, followed shortly after by a somatic feeling throughout the body that made us want to just sit down and melt into the seat. Surprisingly with the strong Indica-feeling attack, it was a fairly functional and clear effect, which we all appreciated (especially since the staff tends to not enjoy the often groggy-feeling Purple strains). The body high was extremely evident from the beginning and stayed fairly constant, but the lingering eyes feeling and a slight burst of energy returning to a sober state were the epilogue of this strain's effects. Nicely potent and medicating, yet mentally clearer than most Purple strains, this is a good option for those who don't tend to enjoy Purples that much.

Puss Kush is often called Pussy Kush or PK, though PK should be used to refer to Pure Kush only.  While Puss Kush greatly resembles the Katsu Bubba Kush (one variety some people refer to as Pre-98), it does have a nose of its own. There are some stories claiming that Puss Kush is is a cross between Bubba and Catpiss, while at least one well respected breeder suggests it is simply a really nice Bubba S1.  While Puss isn't the hype strain of the true PK (Pure Kush) which is truly Suge's Pure Kush and not the oft copied versions floating around (SoCal Pure Kush, et al), it is a wonderful expression of Kush genes.

            Querkle has two main phenotypes: one pheno is shorter and more purple, while the other trends toward the Space Queen and lacks the coloration and also has more of a Sativa effect.  It's a moderate to heavy yielder, especially if it gets a long veg time and lots of root space.
        
            Purple Urkle x Space Queen (Romulan x Cinderella 99)
        
            Romulan and C-99 are both legendary strains despite existing on near-opposite sides of the cannabis spectrum.  Striving to create a grape-tasting plant with a quicker flowering time than the original Urkle mom, TGA/Subcool opted to cross it with their Space Queen, a potent hybrid of C-99 and Romulan.  This shortened flowering time and helped stabilize the plant, creating a variety with only two standard phenotypes and mostly retaining the taste/aroma of the mother.
        
            Much like the Urkle mom, it smells of musky yet sweet grape and dark fruits — the Space Queen-leaning pheno can have notes of the C-99 sharpness as well.
        
            Moderately sweet but with a lovely sharp quality, the flavor is much like the smell, consisting of candy grapes and musky, almost Kush-like flavors. 

            Depends on the phenotype — the Space Queen-dominant one generally offers a slightly more heady Sativa experience.  Normally though, you can expect a relatively sedating experience with major mood elevation, body relaxation, and sleep aid at higher doses.

Romulan is thought to be an Afghani-dominant strain, known for its peppery aroma and strong, narcotic effect.  UBC Chemo was supposedly developed by the Canadian government for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments.  The combination of the two strains produces a very potent hybrid with great medicinal value.

Romulan x Chemo

Romulan came to British Columbia by way of Romulan Joe, a biker from California who was a key member of the "Trinity" grow scene in the 1970's.  He passed the clone on to Federation Seeds, who grew it out on Vancouver Island, eventually crossing it with White Rhino and back-crossing those plants to the original clone over many generations to produce seed stock.  Chemo was thought to be developed by the Canadian government as an aid for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Piney and hashy 

Much like the smell, it's a musky blend of pine and more earthy elements 

Highly sedative and narcotic, this strain is very potent, with both strong mental and physical effects.  The mental effects are mostly present early on, bringing on an internal energy and a cloudy mindstate.  Once that passes, it turns into a near-complete couchlock experience, with a very warm body, loose muscles, and heavy, red eyes.  This strain is very medicinal for patients who need a sleep aid, muscle relaxant, appetite stimulant, and minor pain relief. 

Romulan x Chemo is a short, branchy plant with woody stems that takes on a bonsai-like appearance.  Not suitable for SOG applications, it grows best as a bush and produces a medium yield of round, golfball-like nugs.

S.A.G.E. stands for "Sativa-Afghani Genetic Equilibrium", indicating that the mission for this plant was to provide the best of both worlds.  Many believe that's the case, as this plants has been extremely popular, with some elite selections being grown, cloned, and passed around for 10+ years now.  While it is certainly a hybrid, S.A.G.E. is clearly Sativa-dominant, with some phenotypes going out to 80 days flowering.  Its Haze-heavy mother shines through in the effect and the appearance.

Big Sur Holy x Afghani

A very special Hazy Sativa plant grown at a monastery in the Big Sur area of California (later known as "Big Sur Holy Weed") is the mother to this line.  Adam Dunn used his workhorse Afghani male to balance out the rangy Holy Weed and provide better structure as well as a more palatable flowering time.  S.A.G.E. is considered as T.H.Seeds' flagship strain and is one of Dunn's favorites to this day, being entered as recently as 2012 into the High Times Denver Medical Cannabis Cup's Sativa category.  A couple of special S.A.G.E. cuts are out in the clone scene currently, with the "FoCo S.A.G.E." (out of Ft. Collins, Colorado) perhaps being the most sought-after for its incredible Sativa effect and punchy, spice-heavy aroma.

The plant itself tends to grow with pointed colas which bulk up considerably by finish, with some getting into the "soda can" realm.  The long pistils and large calyxes  make this one fairly easy to trim and also makes for a smooth, easy smoke thanks to the lack of leaves.  Lime green with creamy orange pistils, the trichomes tend to be shorter with large, bulbous heads and medium-thick coverage overall.

A spicy Haze scent with notes of sandalwood, bay leaves, garlic, and a light Dutch Haze type of sweetness at times, which comes through heavily in certain phenotypes.

Though the quicker-finishing Afghan-heavy phenotypes are at times sweet, the flavor of the most prized cuts is similar to its namesake, with a bouquet of spice-like flavors with a fresh nature — this one tastes like a true Sativa, reedy and clean on the palate with an expansive but smooth smoke.

A true hybrid, it starts out strongly Sativa, with an increase in eye/face pressure, an uptick in heart rate, and racing, at-times disjointed thoughts.  While not incapacitating mentally, it does slow things down simply because the mind is being pulled in many different directions, following flights of fancy and craving interaction.  Good for creative pursuits but not as much for settled, detail-oriented work, this one is most conducive to spending a day having fun outside or an evening being productive at home.  The body effects also tend to start off rather early, warming the limbs and core and relaxing the muscles so that they feel loose and floppy.  This is a great daytime strain, giving a boost of energy and also relieving body tension and mental stress, a mostly-functional strain perfect for those who stop just short of the raciest, most cerebral varietals.

Responds well to training, more than doubles its height in flowering.  Produces well and will continue throwing out white pistils if fed any type of nitrogen in flowering — this is acceptable though, as the extra bulk overall is worth the additional time.

            Diesel-dominant, with a smoky element and a backing vegetal sweetness. 

            A strong starter, it hits the face and eyes with lots of cycling pressure, building up over the first 15 minutes.  Spacey and lacking focus, it gives a certain energy that can still manage to be semi-productive.  As the spaciness wears off, it becomes suitable for sedentary tasks, elevating energy and mood.  A smooth drop back to sobriety completes this pleasant Sativa strain's effects.  Most suitable for daytime use, it has strong ocular effects, solid appetite stimulation, gives a boost of energy, and some slight numbing pain relief. 

            According to T.H.Seeds, it grows massive in DWC setups, so root space it at a premium with these plants.  They get tall and will easily double in height when flowering, finishing with foxtailed, fat-calyxed colas of formidable size.

            60-65 days, some phenos will go longer
        
            A wonderful example of hybrid vigor, this strain brings together two strains on nearly opposite ends of the spectrum in the 70+ day flowering Sativa-dominant Sour Diesel and the burly, hashy, trich-covered Indica Deep Chunk.  The flavor and scent expression of the parents changes slightly depending upon medium, phenotype, and growing conditions.  It normally finishes a deep purple color, with both leaves and calyxes darkening as it approaches harvest time.
        
            East Coast Sour Diesel x Tom Hill's Deep Chunk
        
            Bred by Tierra Rojo, this strain has made a home in the Colorado medical marijuana scene, but a special phenotype also still appears in its home state of Texas as the "Texas Hog Plum".
        
            As it's growing, the plants have a deep green and purple coloration that stays intact through harvest and drying/curing.  Most plants have large hooked calyxes that "crown" as the plant reaches maturity, with very fat trichome heads which make fabulous water hash.  It has a moderate amount of leaf coverage, but the main colas are thick and have a better calyx-to-leaf ratio than the lower branches.
        
            The ECSD comes through most clearly in the scent, which has strong notes of rubber, fuel, skunks.  However, there is a creamy, hashy Deep Chunk sweetness that manages to make its way to the forefront now and then.  The astringent aromas dominate post-grind and this is a strain that is easily-noticed from several feet away when disturbed.
        
            When properly-grown, a deep flavor which nearly matches the pungency of the aroma lingers on the palate after smoking.  The flavor is slightly hashier than the aroma, but still has clear skunk, rubber, and fuel elements, especially on the attack.  The smoke tends to be fairly thick and can cause coughing, but if well-trimmed and cured, it can be very smooth for such a potent smoke.
        
            A buzzing throughout the face and head comes on with an immediacy that definitely brings to mind the Diesel side of the family.  It also tends to hit the eyes quite a bit, at times making them burn with effect and continually fluctuating pressure.  The early part of the duration feels rather Sativa in nature (though on the "stoney" and narcotic side of that spectrum) and improves mood while also providing such strong initial potency that it would be difficult to fall asleep.  However, that changes rather quickly (normally around the 1 hour mark) and the Deep Chunk seems to take hold, filling the body with a buzzing relaxation and bringing the mental pace down quite a few notches.  This strain is most suitable for an evening burst of cerebral activity leading into relaxation and eventually sleep.  It's also useful as an all-day medication for users who can continually consume smaller amounts and remain in the Sativa parts of the effect.
        
            While it performs just fine in hydro, these plants tend to really respond to a robust soil or soilless mix, something that will keep them deep green and healthy until it's time to flush.  It forms fairly strong central colas but also has a good amount of leaf, making pruning and a judicious trim necessary.  It handles training well and works for SCROG much better than it does in a single cola SOG style setup — medium sized plants (around 3') tend to taste and smell best.

The Rare Dankness #1 male brings Ghost OG (the real cut), Chem and Triangle Kush to the playing field.  As Scott himself posted on a forum, "The RD#1 male brings a shit ton of resin [and] Chem growth with a nice splash of the OG flavor and smell everyone wants[.]"
The backcross to Triangle Kush brings in even more of the OG family line and traits, making this an extremely potent OG variant, pushing past the Ghost and reaching Face Off levels.

Triangle Kush x Rare Dankness #1

Scott's OG is a varietal avaiable in seed form from Rare Dankness Seeds.  We've heard of a few people finding some very nice phenos in their packs, but possibly the cut regarded as the best is the pheno found by some Michigan growers.  After having won 1st Place in the Growers Cup in 2012 or 2013, Scott was invited to meet the purveyors of the fine flowers.  He was gifted a cut of the winning pheno and made it available commercially to some Colorado retail centers.  The photos in this profile were taken at Green Dream Health Services in Boulder, Colorado and is the verified Michigan Cup winner phenotype.

            Sensi Star is a stout plant with large, dark fan leaves — definitely Indica in profile, it produces dense buds that sparkle with trichomes and give off a sharp lemony musk.  Known for high levels of THC, it's popular for crossing with other strains that lack potency.
        
            Unknown
        
            Created in 1995 by Paradise seeds, it was re-released in 1997 in a more stabilized form, generally producing one of two phenotypes.  It went on to win many awards and become very well-known around the world.
        
            Sometimes it can be sweet and lemony, with notes of eucalyptus — the other tends to be more musky and has a bit of a skunky lemon bite and notes of fuel.
        
            Musky lemon, at times with a putrid sweetness
        
            It does depend on the pheno (there is a more Sativa-leaning pheno), but Sensi Star is known for strong body effects with a touch of head effects to complete the package.  A warm, buzzing, relaxed body combined with a fairly clear mental state make Sensi Star a semi-functional Indica, especially at lighter doses.  Strong eye effects, good muscle tension relief, appetite stimulation, anti-anxiety properties, and sleep aid at higher doses.
        
            Grows vigorously in soil, hydro, or outdoors in temperate climates.  Vegetative growth of about 14 days from clone is recommended, and it works well in Sea of Green (SOG) setups.

            Unknown lineage, thought to be a "selfed" Ghost's OG Kush
        
            Information courtesy of Moonshine: "The SFV is 'San Fernando Valley' which most folks know.  What they don't know is the SFV is actually an S1 (a self seeded) of the ORkid's Ghost OG Kush.  It is very similar to the ORKid cut with a little healthier/sturdier branches.  The medicinal effects and highs are very close in nature, with the SFV generally being a little more somber and meditative.  Lastly, SFV is widely rumored to be the XXX OG Kush because the SFV is where the porn industry is/was generally located.  In reality, the XXX is likely another S1, this time of the SFV."
        
            Lemon-pine cleaner — it lacks the fuel and skunk elements which are often present in other OG Kush cuts. 

            Lemons and spice, it tastes much like the Ghost cut with a little more straight-up lemon flavor. 

            Contemplative and fairly somber, the SFV cut is one that puts the user in a meditative, calm state.  There is a strong and constant pulsing feeling in the body which increases the relaxed feeling.  Only occasional spaciness mars the otherwise clear-headed and aware experience.  Recommended for users who desire a mood-evening strain that will reduce the daily stresses of life while also relaxing the body.

            70-75 days
        
            One of Dutch Passion's early crosses primarily meant for outdoor growing in the northern latitudes of The Netherlands, Shaman is known for most of its specimens turning a deep purple.  The plant isn't a big yielder, and it also isn't the most potent variety, but its pleasant uplifting Sativa effect and complex floral-pine-incense aroma make it a great daytime choice for beginner and intermediate users.
        
            Purple #1 x Early Skunk
        
            During the 1980's "Skunk Boom" in Amsterdam, one of the crosses that came out of the frenzy of Skunk #1-based breeding projects was a strain first called "Purple Skunk".  In 1997, the variety was renamed to "Shaman" by Dutch Passion.  The strain was originally bred to finish outdoors  in the short Dutch growing season, and manages to do that despite its Sativa phenotypical selection.
        
            Dutch Passion claims that approximately half of the Shaman plants in any seed pack will be green rather than purple, but we've never seen one that finishes green.  The buds are a deep purple, almost looking black at times, though the foliage does mostly stay green to finish.  The small buds appear tucked into the green leaves, but once pruned, the large calyxes and deep orange pistils make this a very attractive strain.  We've seen the same "cut" of Shaman several times, and it has continually produced purple-headed trichomes (see pictures above, in both dry buds and live plant form), which is an extremely rare trait.
        
            Though it possesses a light "purple" scent, with notes of incense and a backing Skunky quality, Shaman has a tangy and fresh aroma once broken apart.  Hints of citrus, pine, and the smooth floral purple aroma from the pre-grind smell blend into a surprisingly appealing whole.
        
            Much like the smell, it's not the most pungent thing around, but it is complex enough to keep a veteran user's interest.  A light skunky and floral flavor brings to mind the Skunk more than the Purple side of the family, and the light citrus elements come through as well in the aftertaste.  Beyond the first hit or two, it's mostly an earthy experience, but the smoke is smooth and light when properly grown and flushed.
        
            The Sativa billing from the seed company is not a false one — this strain is very uplifting yet smooth and calming (no signs of anxiety), making it a perfect moderately potent daytime choice when an incapacitating mental effect is not desired.  Social, energetic, and near-euphoric at times, Shaman lasts at a medicinal level for about 1.5 hours, then fades out quickly at about 2.5, leaving behind no side effects.
        
            Shaman is never really a big-yielding variety, but it does seem to prefer being grown in hydro when being cultivated indoors, bulking up a bit more than when grown in soil mixes.  However, the flavor and aroma seem to take on a more pleasing sweetness in soil, so it's mostly a question of what the grower is striving for.

            Like a wet blanket over the brain, this strain is very Hazy and cerebral, also hitting the eyes very strongly and making them low and red.  It is a strain that the user is very conscious of, at times inducing anxiety in professional situations.  It's spacey and generally slows the mind, which is great for relaxation, but not for any detail-oriented activities.  Very little body presence with this one despite its relaxing 2nd half of the duration.

Though it won a Cannabis Cup way back in 1994, we didn't expect a whole lot from this strain, simply because it's very old-school and contains strains that make our collective shoulders shrug. However, this strain showed us that old Dutch seedbank material has its good points, as it provided a great Sativa-hybrid experience and a huge dose of fresh, sweet, fruity notes in both the flavor and the aroma. This particular grow was mostly without flaw, and we especially liked seeing the array of cloudy trichomes, which seems increasingly rare (we often see a bunch of clear heads with patches of ambers mixed in rather than a true progression). While its strong start and at times racy effect may get on top of some inexperienced patients, it was moderately potent overall and would be suitable for daytime relief for mid-to-experienced patients. This is a strong first KindReview for Green Mountain CARE, and we look forward to seeing more choices from their garden.

            Early Pearl x Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5
        
Bred by Sensi Seeds to create an easy-to-grow stress-resistant varietal for indoor cultivation

Claw-shaped asparagus green sepals, arranged in tight closed cluster calyxes, with bursts of burnt umbre pistils, and average coverage with thick-stalked wavy trichomes with large heads

We were almost taken aback at how nice this sample smelled, both in the jar/bag and once it was broken up or ground. It reminded us of some of the better Jack Herer/Jack Flash samples we've had, except with more of the candy sweetness you find in something like Island Sweet Skunk or Cotton CandyRomulan. Sweet, fruity, and floral, it has elements of rose petals, grape candy, and fresh citrus cleaner — these aromas seem to blend and appear at different times, making for a complex and enjoyable experience. While not outwardly pungent like something in the Diesel/Kush family, it was a strong and bold aroma nonetheless.

While it's worth noting that one reviewer didn't seem to care much for the flavor and noted some harshness when burning, the rest of the staff had no such complaints. We got a very fresh, lightly sweet and fruity flavor that seemed to match the pre-grind smell for the most part. It had notes of eucalyptus, citrus, and flowers on the initial hits but burned away into more of a lightly spicy (yet still sweet) flavor that brought to mind cinnamon. The smoke was extremely smooth for the majority of the staff (one using a glass pipe, one using an IncrediBowl) and coughing was minimal. The final ash finished with some dark areas, indicating that a longer or more thorough flush would have been beneficial… that didn't affect the flavor much in our estimation, however.

The effects of this strain were noticed almost immediately after exhaling, with the usual package of Sativa pressure effects rising up into our heads. A fluttery, light feeling in the torso area and an major uptick in both mood and mental activity also added to the Sativa start we experienced. It bordered on anxious at times, but its background body relaxation seemed to help keep us calm and in a positive, borderline euphoric mood. While it was difficult to concentrate on one thing, it seemed to aid with overall mental activity, making some of the staff feel like multi-tasking machines, jumping capably from task to task but never lingering. The fairly excitable state declined in potency after about an hour, then shifted gears at about 1.5 hours to a more relaxing state that lost the at-times anxious edge. The effect's endurance was also somewhat surprising, lasting at a medicinal level for 2 solid hours, then declining quickly from there but lingering in the eyes for a full 3 hours.

We really enjoyed the effects of this strain, which served to really energize us through the peak of the effects without ever feeling anxious or overwhelming. SK9 seemed to go with the flow of the day, making us feel comfortable and capable at nearly any project we took on. The second half came with some drowsiness, but a quick re-medication would fix that. The crisp Haze-influenced aroma and taste were both pleasing, if a bit indistinct, and we had no real complaint about the appearance. We like this strain as a daytime motivator, or perhaps as an after-work "up-then-down" type of med, where you can get things done and then ease into a relaxing night.

Spade-shaped woodland green sepals, arranged in closed stack calyxes, with bursts of ocher pistils, and above-average coverage with short-stalked hooked trichomes with large heads

Sweet and spicy, this strain's Skunk lineage was evident from the start. Though it wasn't an overtly pungent strain, it definitely made its presence known, especially when broken apart. This reminded us of some old school strains for sure, with a fresh quality that brought to mind some of the Haze Skunk hybrids such as Jack Herer.

 Crisp and fresh, it had a taste that almost reminded us of sweet peppers, with some spicy qualities and a hint of sweetness. The smoke was super-smooth and caused almost no coughing, hitting the throat softly and not expanding much at all. 

After finishing the review samples, we became immediately alert-feeling, energized, and motivated to complete various household tasks. While it did lower the eyelids and redden the eyes a bit, there were no other noticeable signs of being medicated, as we felt completely capable in complex conversations and tasks. While this one wasn't a total pain reliever, there was some element of relief, mainly in the neck and shoulder areas. As it progressed beyond 1.5 hours, it definitely became more sedate and relaxing, even bordering on tiring. This is a common occurance with very "uppy" strains, as going back to normal often seems like a dip, when it's really just returning to the median.

            The first true commercial hybrid ever stabilized, it came from California by way of Sam the Skunkman following his release from prison in 1982.  Skunk #1 is a disease and pest-resistant strain that has been bred into countless strains and forms the backbone of much of the Dutch commercial market.  The plant itself is a good producer, exhibiting much hybrid vigor and a high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making trimming a breeze.
        
            Acapulco/Mexican Gold x (Colombian Gold x Afghani)
        
            There is a massive story about Skunk #1 from Outkast Seeds, which can be found at the following link: http://www.rollitup.org/seed-strain-reviews/48884-skunk-1-story.html.  It details the early breeding history and lineage of Skunk #1, the difficulty in stabilization of the Colombian Gold x Afghani side of the equation, the bust of Sacred Seeds and the recovery of seed stock and importation to Holland which followed.
        
            Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of Skunk varieties do not smell skunky, but rather a pungently sweet and slightly fruity smell.  The Dutch and BC Skunks are especially sweet, often carrying an element of creamy citrus.  The original Skunk #1 that was favored by the American breeders was thought to possess more of the real skunk smell. 

            Lightly sweet with a thick, strong smoke, Skunk #1 isn't really known for its taste, but its mix of sweet and hashy flavors is a callback to the early origins of commercial marijuana. 

            Relaxing yet mentally uplifting, Skunk #1 will elevate mood while keeping the user mostly close to the couch.  It provides good pain relief and muscle relaxation qualities while making the user a little bit slow mentally.  This is the standard "high" feeling mixed with some of the sedative elements thanks to the Afghani. 

            Grows well in soil or hydro but the best taste is achieved through organic soil means.  It grows stout and has an Indica-dominant structure, with dense buds, while the Sativa elements contribute a high calyx-to-leaf ratio and hybrid vigor.

With plenty of hybrid vigor and great commercial potential, this cross of two classics is recommended for commercial growers due to its yield and its easy manicuring.

Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5

Normally Skunk-dominant, with a fruity and pungent aroma, it also has hints of the more earthy and piney Northern Lights #5. 

Fairly neutral blend of slight sweetness, pine, and earthy flavors. 

Sedative and feeling rather Indica-dominant, this strain is good for relaxation, sleep aid, and minor pain relief.  The Sativa components of the Skunk seem to have been mostly bred out for commercial purposes… this feels like almost a straight-up Indica with its relaxing and near-tiring effect. 

Grows well in either soil or hydro, good for SOG applications if un-topped, can easily be trained into whatever shape is desired.

While the overall potency and somewhat steep fall-off around 1.5 hours left us wishing for slightly more potency overall, it seems that part of that was due to the overall clarity of the experience — it never felt overbearing or pushy. The smell and taste package are something that most Kush-lovers will fawn over and while it had minimal body effects, it instilled a sense of calm focus that lent itself nicely to quiet work projects.

OG Kush x Sour Diesel

A sativa-leaning OG Kush phenotype that appeared in the California clone scene circa 2003.  Often confused with the Dutch Passion strain, Skywalker, this phenotype (also called Sativa OG), is said to have gotten its moniker after being largely propagated by a grower named Luke.

A slight haze or cloudy feeling comes over the eyes almost immediately, also causing some pressure fluctuations in that area — there was also a pleasant headband/hat-area buzzing that had us feeling quite good immediately. Despite that eye haze, the mental state was very clear throughout, even during the period of initial potency. A clear, vibrant, relaxing OG.

            Much like its sister the Sour Kush, Smelliot starts off with a strong package of Sativa effects immediately, filling the head and eyes with pressure and adding some delay to mental activities.  The spaciness continues as the effect builds over the first 15 minutes, culminating in a rush of thoughts and internal energy that makes doing much of anything a bit difficult.  Cerebral and almost racy gives way to a much more relaxing state in the latter half of the duration, with the body calming down and the mind feeling positive and clear.  Recommended for Sativa-lovers who can handle the initial rush — it's a good creativity and mood-boosting strain, making anxiety melt away in the 2nd half.

A fusion of two of the California medical scene's most potent Sativa clone-only varieties Trainwreck and Snowcap, Snow Wreck is a heavily Sativa strain that fills the user with energy while also knocking them to the couch.

Snowcap x Trainwreck

Snowcap is a Northern California medical scene clone thought to have lineage in the Haze family of plants, while Trainwreck is a legendary California strain thought to have Mexican Sativa and Afghani roots.

Seems Snowcap dominant, with a fruity-pine scent that carries traces of the Trainwreck's menthol-citrus when ground up. 

Piney and fresh, it has a Haze-dominant taste profile. 

Strong and cerebral to start, it can leave the user stuck to the couch simply due to not knowing what to do with themselves.  The Afghani lineage in the Trainwreck is the only thing keeping this strain from feeling completely Sativa, as there is a warming body component.  Potent and long-lasting, Snow Wreck is recommended as a daytime med for those who enjoy strongly Sativa experiences.  Benefits with nerve issues, ocular relief, and appetite stimulation. 

Trainwreck is known for being unstable and throwing out hermie flowers late in flowering, and this cross of two clone-only females would likely be even more unstable in that sense… use caution.

            The sweetest and quickest to harvest of all the original ChemDawg varieties, the SnowDawg (sometimes known as "Super SnowDawg") yields well and forms pointed light green colas which appear almost white with trichomes.  The influence of the Bubbleberry is evident in the aroma and flavor, which sweetens up the often acrid Chem family.
        
            Bubble Chem [Chem Sister x Sagarmatha's Bubbleberry] x (Mass. Super Skunk x Oregon Sno)
        
            This strain came out of the latter ChemDawg projects happening on the East Coast, using many of the same genetic lines which ended up in Sour Diesel and others, including the Massachusetts Super Skunk.  Chem Sister (sometimes "Chem's Sister") is one of the original seeds popped which produced the family line, but is one of the rarer cuts and doesn't have the reputation that the Chem '91 does.  Sagarmatha's Bubbleberry was a special plant at the time, and added heft and sweetness to the equation, while the male used came out of a cross of a Mass. Super Skunk female and an Oregon Sno male.
        
            SnowDawg has a tantalizing and complex aroma which really develops as it is broken apart.  A softly sweet and earthy aroma in its undisturbed state gives way to a blend of fruity sweetness, chemical funk, and earthy citrus that recalls its Chem family origins but seems wholly different.
        
            There are many elements of the aroma present in the flavor, but there is a more direct Chem element, while still displaying a very healthy almost floral sweetness.  The smoke is smooth and crisp, with a mentholated quality which leaves the mouth feeling clean.
        
            Extremely uplifting from the start, SnowDawg has an almost euphoric mental effect which fills the user with energy, positivity, and creativity.  It calms down a little bit as it goes along, but the focused and clear-headed state that composes the rest of the experience is perfect for daytime or early evening use.  Patients seeking relief from depression, anxiety, light muscle pain/tension, or migraines will find great relief here, and it just serves as a wonderful mood elevator, with little 'ceiling' and high value as an all-day medication.
        
            Responds well to training rather than topping, as it produces a good yield from the main colas and will branch out a bit if super-cropped.  As a rule, growing this one in soil gives the most pungent aroma and flavor, while hydro will produce a slightly more impressive-looking plant with additional resin coverage.

Thought to be an accidental cross when the DNL hermied, Sour Diesel (or East Coast Sour Diesel, as it's commonly called) is a special plant in the OG Kush/ChemDawg line of strains.  Its often "crushing" sativa effect actually seems to hit most people as more of an indica, increasing couchlock and being strong to the point of being overwhelming at times.  The plant itself is a fairly lanky one that tends to show lots of foxtailing when finished, practically stinking up the room with its pungent fuel-skunk-citrus bouquet.

When Original Diesel was accidentally crossed with a DNL plant that hermied, it created seed stock that produced the East Coast Sour Diesel (ECSD) clone.  Many seed companies have released crosses with the strain, and some (like Reservoir Seeds) have attempted to reproduce the strain in seed form, releasing a variety of backcrosses and IBLs with varying results.

Sour Diesel displays an extremely pungent blend of fuel, skunk, citrus, and spice that will leak through many jars and bags when the strain is well-grown.  The sharpness gets stronger after breaking it up, adding a stronger kick of citrus as well as a cutting fuel aroma that tickles the nose.

A frontal attack of skunky citrus funk gives way to a mentholated lime-kissed spice which lingers in the mouth.  The smoke is expansive and will definitely cause coughing on larger hits.

Sour Diesel is fairly sativa-dominant but seems to exhibit a headslam of an indica effect at times, especially if let go late into flowering.  It hits the eyes and head immediately, filling them with pressure and energy, while the body seems almost immobile at times, trending heavily towards couchlock — a numbing quality is also often reported, aiding with nerve and muscle pain relief.







Sour Diesel isn't known for being a long-laster at medicinal levels — it's a high peak and then a valley normally, often finishing with the user feeling lethargic and a bit drained after the sativa start.  Sour Diesel often helps with nerve issues, appetite, and can also help as a sleep aid during the "crash" portion of the effects. 

Sour Diesel doesn't yield quite as well as Original Diesel, growing a bit more spindly and with lighter buds, but the yield is still above-average.  Training and netting works very well for this strain, and it will take moderate to high amounts of feeding during flower, bulking up until the very end.  It stretches at least twice its initial height when flowered, more than that without training.

About 75 days, can go as long as 85 days for a less uppy experience — the fuel and funk seems to come out later in flower while the citrus elements are present early on.

Different from the Gage Green Grape Stomper which was renamed "Sour Grapes" by Blue Sky Collective in Oakland, this cut is from Apothecary Genetics and is their Grape Ape crossed with a Sour Diesel. The hybrid produces larger nugs than the Ape and demonstrates the hybrid vigor one would expect from such a cross. The mottled purple coloration and tangy sour grape-meets flowers aroma is immediately enticing to users, while the flavor and potent effects keep them coming back for more.
Sour Grape has shown promise in relief of digestive problems, nausea, anxiety, and moderate muscle tension. It also stimulates the appetite quite a bit while improving mood in an even-handed manner, making it suitable for patients seeking versatile relief for either day or night.

Grape Ape x Sour Diesel

Bred by Apothecary Genetics from their Grape Ape mother, this strain is often confused with "Sour Grapes", an alternate name for Gage Green Genetics' "Grape Stomper", an entirely different cross.  This confusion has not stopped either strain from gaining major popularity in both the California and Colorado medical markets.

Like its parent strain Grape Ape, Sour Grapes tends to be a mottled purple rather than turning entirely purple, with a collection of soft almost pastel-like colors blending into a harmonious whole.  The nugs are of medium density thanks to a bit of Sativa influence added from the Diesel, but they still mostly retain the Grape Ape shape and overall structure.  Trichome coverage is above average but there is still enough room to let the color shine through (it doesn't look white to the naked eye).

An engaging mix of the two parent strains, Sour Grapes has a fairly soft grape sweetness in the bag but blows up into a complex sour fruit aroma with hints of flowers and incense lingering in the background.  It doesn't tend to have outward Diesel elements, but the added sharpness can definitely be detected among the Grape-dominant package of smells.

Sweet and sour grape dominates the flavor, and the Diesel takes a definite backseat, never really being picked up except in that the taste is unlike the standard Grape Ape.  It has an expansive, thick smoke which can often cause coughing.

As would be expected with the parental lineage, the effects feel almost like a 50/50 hybrid of Indica and Sativa, with both seemingly coexisting peacefully rather than pulling the patient one way then another.  A balanced mix of facial and head effects blend with a buzzing body that tends to be most comfortable when immobile, resulting in a relaxed but mentally-aware state that is suitable and fairly productive for sedentary mental tasks, but not particularly suited to more strenuous activity.  It hits hard early on and then peters out quite a bit after the hour mark, converting into more of a base relaxation but still retaining mental clarify and not reaching into the heavy, sleepy end of the Indica spectrum.

A robust plant, Sour Grape branches well and responds positively to SCROG setups but can also be grown untopped for a fairly large single cola and moderate side growth.  This plant can take fairly heavy feedings and grows equally well in soil or hydroponic setups.

            Sour Kush is an amazingly frosty Sativa-dominant hybrid which combines the best elements of Kush and NYCD into one powerful package.  With large calyxes reminiscent of the best Kush cuts, and a cutting, acrid aroma that is easily detected from across the room, Sour Kush has earned a place in the upper echelon of cuttings available.  Bred originally by the elite grower society the "Devil's Harvest Krew", the Sour Kush is an enduring symbol of their talent for picking winners amongst large-scale breeding experiments.
        
            Ghost's OG Kush x Soma's New York City Diesel
        
            Originally bred by Devil's Harvest Krew member "ThaDocta", Sour Kush was created in 2002-03 and the breeding project resulted in another winner of a plant, which was dubbed "Smelliot".  The Sour Kush is sharper-smelling and more potent than the Smelliot, but they are very similar.
        
            Spicy and fuel-tinged, it also has some definite citrus elements present.  It's a very sharp-smelling Kush, getting a boost in pungency from the NYCD's citrusy punch.
        
            Sharp and aggressive, it retains some of the smoother Kush elements, but is NYCD-dominant overall, with a super sour and acrid flavor that lingers on the palate.  A sharper, more astringent version of NYCD is what Sour Kush is often described as, but some low-lying Kush flavor can be detected.
        
            The initial 30 minutes of this strain can be a little much for some people, as it starts very strong and borders on psychedelic at times, increasing the heart rate and causing some racing thoughts.  Energetic and heady to start, it transitions into a more Kush-heavy state of alert, smooth body relaxation where the body feels light, buzzy, and capable.  Sour Kush elevates mood, increases appetite, and reduces tension/pain, while keeping the user mostly capable and aware (the initial attack aside). 

            Does well in both hydro and soil, but doesn't like a lot of feeding in general.  It yields better than Ghost or SFV, but it takes an expert hand to get the most out of her.

The Willie Nelson father is Highland Nepalese x Vietnamese Black

Broad arrowhead-shaped wasabi green sepals, arranged in foxtailed stacked calyxes, with bursts of piper red pistils, and above-average coverage with average-stalked trichomes with large heads

A pungent Diesel presence was in the forefront when this strain was sitting in the jar/bag, with a skunky and slightly acrid scent propelling a hint of citrus. When we ground it up, the Diesel elements seemed to fade away, giving instead a lightly sweet and complex aroma with hints of fruit and spice. The change was unexpected and refreshing, because Sour Diesel seems to completely take over so many crosses.

The flavor was a bit confusing and not as pungent as the aroma, giving us a sharp attack with just a hint of Diesel, then basically leaving behind a clean, fresh, mentholated feeling in the mouth rather than much of a taste. The smoke was smooth and didn't cause coughing except on the largest hits, while the flush appeared to be nearly perfect, leaving behind only a fluffy white ash. This one was enjoyed by all and was repeatedly described as "pleasant", but just didn't wow us with a pungent flavor.

This strain hit us with an almost entirely Sativa package of effects, increasing both the mental and physical energy of our staff, filling us with a buzzing body and head presence. Facial warmth, ocular/temple pressure, some body numbing, and a racing heart continued through most of the initial hour, eventually backing off slightly into a less racy and cerebral state. We found conversation easy when it was around, but it was also easy to get stuck in your own head so to speak, staring off in space while deep in thought, or zoning in on a project and shutting out the outside world. The buzzing body continued throughout most of the experience and served to make this a fairly versatile med in terms of context, making us equally satisfied with activities or relaxation. A smooth decline in effect left us feeling relaxed but still aware, with no real crash to speak of.

Chem-4 x Tres Dawg

Chem 4 was an original seed popped after a Grateful Dead tour 1991 when two guys from Colorado networked with a fellow fan from Masachusetts. One ounce of supreme quality "Dog Bud" (the nickname given to the original plant, possibly originating in Oregon) had a handful of seeds. Of those seeds, one was Chem Dog 4. An allstar of it's own, it was bred to Tres Dawg, a Chem Dog exclusive breeding project. By compounding desired traits in the flowers, Stardawg is remarkably dense, pungent and stoney.

Sprouting from perhaps the most influential strain in the modern cannabis market, Stardawg is the cumulation of two Chem Dawg (Chem Dog) strains, of which also spawned from exclusive Chem Dog breeding projects. The legend of Chem Dog, later named Chem Dawg by Top Dawg Seeds, is grand and since the early 90's the strain has become a common ancestor of most strains enjoyed in the 21st century.

Stardawg has a dense, velvety texture. Large buds are common in growth and unlike other Chem Dog strains, hold together with minimal stem weight and have an original Skunk #1 appeal.

Stardawg is alarmingly potent in chemical, acidic and pine fragrances. Like it's counterparts in the Chem Dog family, It truly smells like a dead skunk and has a very pevasive odor.

The musk lingering in the ambient aroma translates directly to flavor, where one may have a salivating or lip smacking reaction when consuming. Thus, it's a favorite for processing into concentrates and the lineage of Chem Dog has spread to most modern day strains.

Categorized as a sativa-dominant hybrid, Stardawg has varying effects, mostly relying on personal preference as a guide. For some, Chem Dog strains, and Stardawg in particular, gives a very uplifting, motivational experience most commonly found in sativas. Conversely, some will feel a lethargic ambivalent reaction that is typically enjoyed with indicas. As a result, different shops and seed companies market Chem Dog and Stardawg as indicas or sativas. It's a safe bet to expect a rich THC experience as it typically tests above average compared to other strains.

The orignal Chem Dog(s) were born from a bag of "Dog Bud" brought from Colorado to Massachusetts. Dog Bud is believed to be an unknown strain from Oregon from the 1980's or perhaps even before. From there, Top Dawg Seed Company has proliferated the lineage to extreme popularity. It is rumored that there are still a few original Chem Dog seeds yet to be germinated.

A result of successive breeding projects of Chem Dog (or Chem Dawg), Stardawg is an elite clone-only strain that exemplifies the most desired traits from the original from back in the early 90's.

            The smell is almost like rotting fruit, with a slightly putrid and musky element to it.  

            Rather neutral and in the earthy/herby category. 

            Focusing mostly on the head, Starfruit exhibits a swirling and vibrating feeling around the skull which encourages a relaxed mindset.  It was a bit of a creeper, increasing in effect and causing a pressure jump in the eyes and a pain-free and relaxed body.  It helped with appetite, general relaxation, and pain relief while remaining nicely clear-headed throughout.

            Again, strong and musky, with some of the Bubba Kush dark tastes (coffee, chocolate, garlic) and just a slight sweetness that comes out at times 

            Overwhelming at times, Stone Mountain is very potent and hits strong with a direct Indica effect almost immediately.  A deep, pervading sense of relaxation, strong muscle tension relief, and definite sleep aid properties at higher dosages.  Recommended for experienced patients who can handle the potency and desire strong Indica-dominant relief — this one has shown great promise in relieving the side effects of chemotherapy and cancer including loss of appetite, pain, nausea, headaches, and muscle tension.
        
            Stretches more than the Bubba Kush mother.  A long and thorough flush is recommended to bring out an array of fall colors, which normally get overtaken by purple as the plant finishes.
        
            Bubba Kush is thought to be an Afghani/Pakistani variety, while DJ Short's Blue Moonshine is out of California — this cross was created by Scott of Rare Dankness Seeds, prior to the establishment of that company

            The sweet berry cream elements dominate, but there is a sharp Haze in the background. 

            Slightly flowery and almost soapy at times, there is a bit of fruity sweetness, but it changes places from the smell and takes its turn in the background. 

            Uplifting and cerebral, bordering on trippy at times… the Haze definitely comes through most strongly in the experience.  It does carry a solid body relaxation component, but ultimately it's a head-centric strain. 

            Grows well anywhere, it's a hearty plant thanks to the Indica side of its parentage, branching out and staying relatively short throughout its life cycle.  Good for SCROG setups, not advisable for SOG due to the side branching.

The sweet Swiss Sativa on the mother's side gives this strain its distinct sugary berry aroma and taste, while the workhorse NL #5 x Haze on the "father's side" (this is feminized stock, so it was also a female plant) adds robust growth and vigor while reducing overall size.  With tight internodal spacing, it is a solid choice for Haze lovers who don't want a gigantic plant that is impossible to keep contained indoors.  The structure also tends to be fairly linear, making it a good choice for SOG methods and other vertical growing.

Swiss Sativa x (Northern Lights #5 x Haze C), also called "Arjan's Strawberry Haze"









Created by Arjan, Green House's master breeder during the period of 2000-2004, it was finally released to rave reviews in 2006.

Saccharine sweet strawberry + melons + flowers aroma, one of the sweetest-smelling sativas you'll find. 

Slightly less pronounced than the smell, the flavor is still almost identical to the aroma, with its candy-like fruit flavor lasting through the majority of the dosage. 

Energetic without being rushy, this is a social, creative type of sativa that elevates mood and sparks the mind. 

Tastes best in soil but produces best in hydro, like many strains.  Grows very well outdoors and finished mid-October in Northern hemispheres, often as a massive 7 ft. bush.

About 75 days

Smelling fruity and sweet, the Sour Diesel elements seem to come through more on the smoke, chasing off the berry notes.  Several versions exist, but the most common version is a mellow Sativa that gets its smell from the Strawberry Cough and its appearance and flavor primarily from the Sour Diesel/Kush side of the family.

Strawberry Cough x Raspberry Kush x Sour Diesel — multiple versions appear to exist, as Strawberry Cough x OG Kush and OG Kush x California Indica (from Royal Dutch Genetics) are also listed in various sources

Sweet and fruity, very much reminiscent of the strawberry and raspberry genetics — only a hint of sharpness 

Spicy and Kush-dominant, lacking the fruitiness that was present in the smell. 

Sort of a dual experience, this feels like a true hybrid in that it has a buzzing Sativa body energy but the mental state is supremely relaxed.  It seemed to affect the face and eyes rather heavily, making it feel slightly tiring at times despite the body never feeling drowsy.  It was a worthy strain for pain distraction but didn't seem to actually relieve it.  Appetite stimulation, general relaxation, and ocular attention are the main medical benefits — recommended as an anytime sort of medicine, only at higher doses would it get to the overwhelming area.

The smell is something very unique that most of us hadn't encountered previously, a very refreshing and complex aroma that reminded us of other strains but always threw a wrench into the mix with an unexpected whiff of something. The effects were certainly Indica-dominant in the "stoned" vein where sitting on the couch relaxing and staring blankly at a movie seems like a great idea, making this a highly recommendable evening medication. It's great for unwinding at the end of the day without being incapacitated and serves to prepare the body and mind for a night of restful sleep.

In-house strain bred by Grasshopper Wellness in Colorado

Claw shaped fern green calyxes , formed in tight closed clusters, with robin red pistils, and an above average density of average length, thin stalked trichomes with large heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomes

This strain has a very unique aroma that brought to mind a variety of sharp yet sweet scents. A burst of lime-kissed cleaner meets a sugary cherry syrup quality — it's certainly very sweet but the freshness and sharpness adds a complex dimension that was not noticed before breaking/grinding it up. Top-notch aroma here, and very unique.

The initial flavor was much like the smell — a more flowery and smooth version of the lime-pine-sweetness combination. As the taste progressed though, it took on more of a holiday spice + anise quality, with an interesting sharp muskiness. The flavor degraded quite a bit th0ugh as it progressed, making us cough quite a bit and leaving a slightly funky aftertaste. Flush-wise, it could definitely use some work, as the final ash was a somewhat murky dark gray for most of the review staff.

This strain started off with a little mental boost, serving to slap us awake a little bit with its potency. There were a strange package of pressure effects with this one, with multiple reviewers reporting strong jaw, ear, and forehead pressure — the ears were especially unique, as they were both warm and pressurized. Beyond the odd physical sensations with this one, it moved quickly into an Indica state of goofy, slightly lazy relaxation where mental function was intact, but just barely. Definitely a couchy movie-watching type of strain, though even concentrating on something like that might be a little more difficult than normal. Dropping in effect quite a bit after 1.5 hours, it had a smooth comedown that left us feeling relaxed and ready for bed, depending on the timing of medication.

This is a pretty even hybrid, providing some strong Indica presence from the Hashplant and the Sativa sweetness of the Sugar #7.

Sugar #7 x Hashplant

Lightly sweet but overall fairly earthy/hashy like most Hashplants 

Nondescript flavor with a background of sweetness — normally described as "hashy" 

The start is rather heady and Sativa in nature, but it quickly shows its true colors as an Indica-dominant hybrid, with strong body relaxation properties and a mildly hazy mental state.  Recommended as a late evening/night medication primarily, as the latter parts encourage sleep.

With its strong and sweet lemon qualities in both the smell and taste, this strain certainly lives up to its reputation and name when well-grown.  With the indica lineage present in the sativa-dominant hybrid, it results in a rather calm experience for a haze-based strain — rather balanced between head and body effects overall.  The plant grows with short internodes and responds well to topping.  The standard shape for the untrained plant is a Christmas tree-style sativa, with solid buds that have a high calyx-to-leaf ratio.

The Lemon Man is the holder of the original Lemon Skunk mother, which has roots reaching back nearly 20 years into the Las Vegas-area growing community.







Thought to be an original Sacred Seeds Skunk #1 release with a special lemony scent and flavor, the original Lemon Skunk made its way to Amsterdam and into the hands of Arjan, Green House Seeds' chief breeder.  He crossed it with a spectacular and highly Sativa-looking Super Silver Haze male, and as they say, "the rest is history…"

Strongly citrusy (lemon peel, grapefruit), often smelling sweet like Lemonheads candy — the Haze elements come through in the form of a flowery and spicy undertone.

Rather lemony with some flowery elements, almost identical to the smell when grown properly.

A motivational, creative, mood-elevating experience, Super Lemon Haze also comes with an array of body effects.  A buzzing, relaxed body that feels capable makes the elevated mood especially enjoyable.  This is a great daytime outdoorsy strain, perfect for a summer day spent doing activities or simply enjoying the day.  The medicinal qualities include: mood elevation, anti-anxiety, body relaxation, ocular attention, creativity, and appetite stimulation.

Works well indoors or out, and works well in high-EC hydro or soil setups.  Soil tends to bring out more of the lemon flavor and smell.  Plants grow tall but respond well to topping.

            Perhaps the most award-winning strain ever created, Super Silver Haze was the prized brainchild of renowned Green House breeder Shantibaba.  A fusion of 2 of the most desirable commercial strains (Skunk #1 and Northern Lights #5) and the racy and rangy Haze C, SSH is considered by many to be the perfect Sativa-dominant hybrid, combining the best in mental and physical effects.  The addition of the Skunk and NL keep the flowering times and size manageable for indoor growth, making the normally-equatorial Haze feasible for indoor growing.

            Energetic and a little racy immediately, it fills the head with a variety of cycling pressure and a buzzing but at times misguided energy.  It's one of those that gets you out of your seat and looking for something to do, but often results in meandering and lots of random activities rather than anything focused.  At times increasing visual and auditory sharpness, this strain is great for creative types as well.  As it progresses, the Skunk and NL influences come into play, making it more of a relaxing experience over the second half of the duration, including some quality body relaxation and pain relief.  Recommended as a daytime or early evening med primarily, it has great energetic, ocular, motivating, creative, appetite stimulation, and mood-elevating properties.

We appreciated how smooth the whole experience felt, from the pleasantly cool and mentholated smoke to the steadiness of the mood elevation and ocular effects. This one fits somewhere in the functional daytime Indica category at lower dosages, but creeps into the nighttime Indica category when the dosage is stepped up, and especially without remedication, as the end of the experience was fairly tiring for our staff.

Fat arrowhead-shaped olive drab sepals, arranged in loose cluster calyxes, with frequent bursts of light ochre pistils, and average coverage with long thin-stalked wavy trichomes with average heads

The crisp, clean, fresh-smelling aroma that this strain produced definitely brought to mind both of the parents, as well as other strains such as Colorado Cough, Snowcap, and other NL #5/Haze variants. It almost tingles the nose with a mentholated flowery sweetness, getting quite a bit more pungent when it's broken apart.

The flavor was almost exactly like the aroma, which is normally a good sign in our minds. Clean and smooth, it was a little sweet going in and left behind a flowery, mentholated aftertaste which left the mouth feeling fresh and the lungs breathing easy. The fluffy light gray and white ash left behind was further evidence of the proper flush, dry, and cure that this sample appeared to have received.

The initial effects of this one were Sativa in nature for the majority of our staff, serving to wake up our minds a bit and just provide a little jolt to the system due to the potency. We also got some early facial effects (specifically in the jaw and eye areas, strangely enough) and an immediate mood elevation, which had use feeling functional and content. After the first 30-45 minutes, the experience took a heavy turn for one of our reviewers, where he was almost falling asleep on the couch mid-evening (a rarity), due in large part to the at times heavy eye effects, which made them feel sunken, heavy, and a little dry. The other reviewers didn't get to the point of falling asleep, but it did start feeling heavier in general, providing quite a bit of relaxation, both mentally and physically. For an Indica-dominant hybrid, the end of this one felt suspiciously similar to the "crash" that one often feels at the end of a high-octane Sativa experience, leaving us a bit drained and tired, but still mentally positive and happy.

            Sativa-dominant hybrid
        
A fusion of some pretty ridiculous genetics, this strain is caked with tall, fat-headed trichomes and produces a hearty fuel-Kush stank when disturbed.

Super Sour Deez (Sour Diesel IBL x Sour Lemon Larry OG Kush) x Fire White OG Kush (OGRaskal's Fire OG Kush x Krome's The White)

Not a ton of information available on this particular hybrid, but from Elite Genetics' website, it appears that it would be a 9-10 week flowering.  As far as the parent strains go, Elite is known for breeding with an IBL (inbred line, meaning highly stabilized) Sour Diesel for many of their projects, including this one.  OGRaskal's Fire OG Kush is one of the super-elite Kush clones floating around the world right now, and Krome's "The White" cut (aka Triangle) is another of the absolute top-level clones.  All the parent strains sport a strong fuel or Kush element to their taste and smell, making this strain a pretty incredible concentration of those flavor and aroma terpenes.

A near-overwhelming blend of fuel, gun oil, and chemical stank and the more subtle flowery/spicy notes of the Kush.  Skunky from a distance, it yields some fennel and citrus aromas when broken up and allowed to settle a bit.  A real "must smell" for Kush and Diesel lovers… 

Much like the smell, it's a true fusion of the harsh and acrid Sour Diesel flavors and the subtle Kush, which includes spice and citrus.  Enduring and never taking a bad turn, the smoke was flavorful, thick and powerful without being a total lung-buster. 

Very strong off the bat, with a spacey mental state and the urge to just sit and soak in the world, this strain is certainly above-average in potency.  A Sativa effects package to start with lots of head/eye pressure fluctuations, changes in visual perception, and a boost of energy.  Despite the potency, it leaves you able to focus if needed, generally on one task at a time.  It shifts gears around the 2 hour mark, converting into more of a sedating experience with solid body relaxation properties.

Unexpectedly sweet and fruity, this strain will certainly please those patients who place smell on the top of their list of qualities to look for. But even if that's not your thing, the effects were genuinely enjoyed by all of the staff, especially as a late-day or night-time med when relaxation is the goal. A very interesting strain indeed, though we wish the duration was a little longer.

            Black Domina IBL
        
Bred by Sweet Seeds in Spain to be a sweet-smelling high-yielding Indica with good resistance to fungus and disease, they self-pollinated an award winning Black Domina held since 1998.

Spearhead shaped avocado green calyxes, formed in loose closed clusters, with copper pistils, and an average density of long, thin-stalked trichomes with average heads, and lithocysts protruding.

Totally unexpected except for that it was in the name, this strain was extremely sweet-smelling, reminding us of movie theater red rope licorice or a strawberry fruit roll-up — wonderful sweet, fruity scent with no trace of the normal musk seen in the parent strains. Truly a top-notch smell package for people who like sweet and fruity… the pungency is quite remarkable as well.

Though one reviewer picked up some sweetness, this one was thought to be mainly earthy and much more reminiscent of the usual Afghani varietals. This one had a variety of woodsy and earthy tastes but also a twang that reminded one reviewer of fancy cheeses. It was a rather smooth smoking experience but left a medium gray ash and likely could've used a slightly longer flush.

Truly a pure Indica/Afghani experience, this strain provided great relaxation properties throughout the body and mind, but especially in the upper back/shoulder/neck area, which felt particularly nice. A creeping head effect (one reviewer mentioned a "headband feeling") was mostly concentrated in the eyes and also led to a slightly slow and goofy mental state with an elevated mood. Once the main potency passed, it felt extremely functional though relaxing, finishing back at a normal energy level.

Sweet Sweet is a great yielder for a sativa and is thought to be a prime phenotype of the original Skunk #1. As the common ancestor to nearly all strains in the modern cannabis market, Skunk #1 hasn't lost its power punch in the three decades it has blessed the cannabis community and is evident in this sharply flavored specimen.

Skunk #1

Bubblegum and hard candy

Skunky, heavy bodied smoke lingers in the mouth and permiates the surrounding air with the aroma of a 70's dorm room. 

One of the more gentle sativas, Sweet Sweet will give users a more relaxed, less rushing high than perhaps a Haze variety would. Still potent, you should expect increased thought production, heart rate and motivation.

A nice strong start that made me kind of dizzy and admittedly aimed my mind in some strange directions. Two troughs and two crests in this wave, drowsy/lazy, then motivated…twice. While in a crest phase, I was able to play my musical instrument with noticeable skill and focus. The trough phases were better suited for the couch.

A very special phenotype of Soma's original NYCD x G-13/Haze, Tangerine Haze was discovered by the Devil's Harvest Krew (DHK) in 2003-04 and has since become something of a legend, especially in Colorado. The plant is one of the most uncanny-smelling fruity strains on the planet, smelling and tasting exactly like a freshly-peeled tangerine, down to the sensation of the semi-bitter skin. It grows tall and vigorously, forming strong creamy-orange colas that perfume the room.
One of the most often overlooked elements of the DHK was the ability of its members to grow out multiple identical packs of seeds, compare the best females in order to find true keepers. The DHK Tangerine Haze is one such example. Members picked up the original G13/Haze x NYCD from Soma Seeds in 03-04 and over the next year each grew out his pack of seeds, compared the best females, and it was obvious which female stood out (at least in flavor). Nicknamed Tangerine Haze, this strain is still fairly hoarded even though it has been passed freely for the last couple of years. The strain made its way from the West Coast of Canada to Boulder and Nederland, Colorado, where it became something of a legend among the growers and connoisseurs of the area.

Original Soma Seeds New York City Diesel x G-13/Haze

The smell of Tangerine Haze is legendary as being one of the few fruit-named strains that is a perfect replica of its namesake, filling the sinuses with a pungent and uncanny tangerine smell with a floral backdrop.  If it's let go beyond 65 days, it often takes on an astringent quality, so most growers like to take her down early if anything.

The flavor is almost more tangerine-heavy than the scent, even going as far as to give the flavor of the semi-bitter skin or citrus zest along with the fresh citrus attack.  The flavor tends to linger in the mouth and sinuses for a long time after consumption, which increases the already amazing taste appeal of this strain.

Tangerine Haze isn't the strongest strain around, but it lives up to its Haze name, uplifting the user's mindstate and filling the body and mind with a buzzing energy.  Great for creative pursuits, outdoor activities, and anything that can be enhanced with a slight shift of perspective - Tangerine Haze is a wonderful daytime strain that leaves the user feeling capable and at-ease mentally.

Tangerine Haze grows tall and works best when it's flowered early on from clone, when the plant is approximately 10" and has just established itself.

Like many Sativas, this one hit our staff a bit differently depending on the time of day and incoming mood — your experience may vary according to the same. It's definitely a strong Sativa though, which we would probably peg at around 85%… the effects package was almost entirely mental and/or body energy. While the taste was a bit confusing, the rest of the appeal categories were definitely above-average, displaying very traditional Sativa structure and texture that's always nice to see. We recommend this to those patients who are looking for a Sativa to give them a boost of energy but don't mind a possible bit of anxiousness — depending on how it affects you, your mental state should still be active and engaged… whether or not the body follows along is another matter.

            ((Heirlom Thai) x (Landrace Ruderalis) x Danish Passion) x Short Term Amnesia
        
Bred by Bald Monkey seeds to be an early-finishing autoflowering Sativa variety 

Not very pungent in the jar at all, this strain had a sweet-sour and slightly putrid tropical fruit bouquet when ground up, reminding one reviewer of papaya. This was a fairly unique smell, though not pungent enough to be all that impressive.

The majority of reviewers picked up on darker sweet flavors, such as roasted marshmallows, coffee, and nuts… but one reviewer (using an Incredibowl) caught a faint distinct yet disitinct fruit skin taste that danced peach skin that and grapefruit peel as the bowl burned. 

Rushy thoughts immediately crept into our heads as this medication took hold, energized and borderline anxious with mental energy as well as a physical buzzing throughout the body. It could certainly be described as "heart-racing" at first — it really felt strongly Sativa from the outset, hitting the eyes and head with lots of pressure fluctuations as well and inducing a cerebral, philosophical, and slightly psychedelic mental state. Our team was a bit split on the rest of the experience, with half of us reporting a fairly functional (yet rushy and a bit spacey) energy and the other half feeling mentally energetic but not feeling like doing much of anything. We all agreed that it left us a bit drained after the fact though, as it returned us to a normal energy level, then dipped below that to the point where we were actually drowsy-feeling.

The Tang Tang is from Grindhouse Medical Seeds' Sonja line (derived from Blockhead but Sativa-dominant) and adds some needed heft, vigor, and yield to the normally stingy Pre-'98 Bubba Kush mom.  The different phenotypes are almost like different strains, with the Bubba-dominant phenos taking on the rounded shape and large calyxes of the mother, and the Tang Tang growing pointed colas with leaves coated from stem to tip with trichomes.  A skilled selection process will yield incredible results with this one.  

Pre-'98 Bubba Kush x Tang Tang males

This strain was released in 2010 by Grindhouse Medical Seeds.  The particular phenotypes shown above were isolated by breeder "Tierra Rojo" during that same year, in an effort to find the two ends of the parental spectrum.

The Bubba-dominant plants definitely recall the mother, but have a less foreboding and musky aroma, seemingly being freshened up by the herbal and zesty Tang Tang.  Both phenos have notes of incense, hash, citrus, and the backing  deep chocolate/coffee notes of the Bubba, but the Tang Tang just has less aroma overall, smelling mostly of the trichomes that coat every surface.

With a background of the Bubba dankness, the flavor is lightened up by the Tang Tang, adding elements of citrus and herbs.  The flavor isn't overwhelmingly strong like a proper Bubba is, but it hands in the mouth in much the same way, reminding the user of the flavor seemingly at random for a while after smoking.

The Tang Tang adds a potent package of head effects and seems to step up the overall potency of the Bubba.  The Tang Tang phenotypes have a very strong head presence, with a feeling of a boulder rolling around inside the back of the skull at times, as well as quite a bit of eye pressure fluctuation.  It has major mood elevating properties as well, finishing cleanly and without any sort of crash — it makes for a versatile medication suitable for day or night use.  The Bubba-dominant phenotypes are definitely heavier, and if let go long will pack quite the narcotic punch, aiding sleep and relaxing muscles.

Grows well with heavy training such as "super-cropping", as the Tang Tang line adds more flexibility and strength to the often brittle Bubba branches.  Either phenotype produces much larger yields than the Bubba, with the Tang Tang phenos being especially prolific.  The nugs produced are extremely dense, so bud mold can be an issue in higher-humidity environments.  The Tang Tang plants will stretch at least twice their height when flowered, while the Bubba-dominant phenos stay slightly more compact.

Named "The White" for the color of the finished buds (which absolutely drip with resin glands), this strain seems to be somewhere in the Kush family but is thought to have come from Triangle, an elite Florida strain. Though it's not considered a true OG among most collectors, it's reached the stratified air shared with those elite OG cuts in terms of rarity and overall value. The potency tends to be the most noteworthy trait of the strain aside from its incredible appearance, with many growers complaining of an overall weak taste compared to other OG-derived lines.
A tidbit from Krome: "My strain 'The White' has no relation to White Widow to the best of my knowledge. It's called The White for one reason only; the color of the buds when finished. Looks like they were just rubbed in confectionery sugar or something. The real name of the strain is "Triangle."  Got the name from being a 3 way cross. Has nothing to do with location, as I'm far away from Cali and to the best of my knowledge, it was born and raised in my home town. The Triangle Kush is another local strain that's been around for years. I really don't want to get into its origins as it always seems to start a heated debate."

Unknown, thought to be a phenotype/S1 bagseed from Triangle

Straight from Krome via Lucid on icmag.com forums:  "My favorite plant in the garden.  It's got a few names around my way, but the most common is simple "The White."  For me, this is the one that I judge all others by.  This one has the high, flavor, potency, looks, everything.  The only thing is that it yields like crap.  I got it as a clone about 8 years ago from a friend and haven't stopped growing her since.  From what I've gathered it was from some seeds called "The Triangle."  Some friends grew it out and weren't too thrilled and gave a cut to a friend. When he grew it it was the bomb! It's been around in clone ever since."

Very OG family line dominant in structure and yield, but the dried flower is just covered in large gland trichs - truly "caked."

Lemon, pine, and hash, with some oddly sweet qualities creeping in at times — definitely "kushy" in nature, though not as sharp as some OGs, trending instead towards the musky side of things.

Not necessarily known for its taste (many breeders cross it for its trichome coverage with another, tastier strain), The White gives off a pine-heavy taste with hints of Kush spice.  The smoke is thick and expansive, filling the chest and often causing coughing, especially on larger hits.

Very strong starting from the relatively quick onset, The White smacks the user in the face with a variety of cycling facial and cranial pressure changes as well as a warming sensation that creeps up behind the eyes.  The body buzzes, and the entirety of the patient generally feels heavily medicated by 30 minutes in — though The White tends to keep the user sedentary, the mind remains fairly active and acute.  A good strain for relaxing, it calms the body and mind without being overtly heavy or indica in nature until later in the duration, when the eye effects tend to lull the user to an early slumber.  With strong mental and physical effects, The White has solid muscle-relaxing, pain relief, and anti-anxiety properties as well as stimulating appetite.  The effect tends to get heavier as it goes along, so some patients will find sleep aid properties to be present as well.

The White is a pretty big feeder, though not a great yielder… it normally stretches 100-125% during flowering and responds well to early topping.  Fairly aggressive pruning of lower branches is recommended to maximize production of top and "neckbone" bud sites, which will produce the best, most dense final product.  It yields a little bit better than some finicky OG varietals, but is still definitely a connoisseur "headstash" type of plant as opposed to a production plant.  Copious early resin production makes some people cut her early, but the last few weeks is when she really piles on the trichomes, so patience is a virtue.

Likely of Pakistan-Afghanistan origin originally, The White was popularized by Krome, who is out of the Southeast USA

            Hybrid, trends towards Indica dominance
        
Some growers take it as early as 50 days, but it's most ready at around day 57-59, when the resin production is at its maximum.

Without knowing much about what goes into this cross, it's hard to say which elements of the breeding were picked up in the experience. It was definitely Sativa-dominant during the initial effects part, but shifted gears heavily around the mid-way point, making this feel more like a 60/40% Sativa type of hybrid experience. The structure and texture were superb, while the rest of the "bag appeal" areas were only average. This one started off rather potent but seemed to tail off majorly, with the 2nd half feeling more like residual effects than anything. Overall though, we recommend this to mid-level patients who desire a smooth-smoking Sativa hybrid that won't keep them at peak potency for too long while also providing some quality body/mental relaxation, possibly leading to sleep (we'd suggest it as a late afternoon/early PM strain).

Arrowhead shaped fern green calyxes, formed in loose open clusters, with burnt umber pistils, an average density of very long, thin-stalked trichomes with small heads, and a carpet of peltate trichomes and lithocysts.

Though it wasn't pungent really, the smell was a pleasingly fresh-smelling blend of pine (at times with a chemical bent to it), vegetation, and a light sweetness.

There just wasn't much to this sample taste-wise — it seemed to mostly taste like smoke. It was never unpleasant though, only taking a turn for the worse towards the very end of the session. The smoke itself was light and easy to inhale, making this a good choice for those who don't wish to cough.

Coming on somewhat quickly but reaching its full potency around 20 minutes into the experience, this strain started us off with a Sativa-heavy package of effects combined with some body attention. A pulsing, energetic feeling throughout the body (and radiating up into the head) combined with some burning in the eyes and a spacey mental state, making this one feel rather potent to start. Despite the energetic body presence, we had the urge to stay seated, partly to process the experience. Once that passed, it took a hard left turn at Indica and left us even more pulled into the couch, with a heavy head/eyes, slouchy posture, and the urge to lay down.

The "bag appeal" for this one was very high, and it boasts a complex taste and smell package led into a supremely energetic but unfocused state that may be good for creativity but made it a little difficult to deal with daily tasks. This was a very strongly Sativa experience, complete with slight "crash" at the end — people who cannot handle the racy varieties should steer clear of this one, as that was its main property.

Claw shaped wasabi green calyxes, formed in loose open spiral clusters, with pale gold pistils, an average density of very short, average-stalked trichomes with average heads

Reminding us of expensive hand soaps, tropical fruit and dryer sheets, the aroma from the Third Dimension was a relatively sweet pine-citrus sharpness. with a little whiff of skunk The sweet elements came out more after a grind, but it was relatively pungent even in the jar.

Much like the aroma but less pungent, the flavor was an odd, yet appealing mix of citrus chemical pine and an almost flowery/perfumed sweetness. We wish it was more pungent, but it was a bit of an ethereal taste. 

The primary mental effect was a sense of an almost frenzied focus that would jump between things but rarely stayed on the "important" ones… a scatter-brained focus if that makes sense. Due to that, the energy didn't feel particularly productive and left us unsure what to really do with ourselves at times. That eventually passed and left a much more focused and productive state, though without the buzzing energy… this med left us feeling a little drained by the end.

A legendary Northern California strain, Trainwreck is known for its potent and soaring Sativa effects package.  It's lemon-lime + menthol + acrid smell and taste is famous worldwide.  The plant itself often looks gray due to the heavy trichome coverage and has a vine-like heavily Sativa structure with minimal leaf count and large calyxes.

Unknown, likely (Lowland Thai x Mexican Sativa) x Afghani

Trainwreck is thought to be a combination of a Lowland Thai variety that was brought back to the US in an attempt to mimic Thai Stick.  Crossing that with a Mexican Sativa (brick weed) and Afghani stock produced this plant that finishes fairly quickly once flowering is triggered.  The strain was perfected and popularized in Humboldt County, California, particularly Arcata, where the "E-32? (meaning type E, 32nd rotation) Trainwreck became the eventual popular "mother".

Citrus-menthol-pine is the dominant smell — it's sharp with an occasional fruitiness creeping through 

Citrus-dominant, sometimes carrying an acrid, fuely component and the same mentholated quality from the smell 

Sometimes racy, but always very potent, Trainwreck is in the "crusher Sativa" mold, delivering a nearly incapacitating package of mental effects that can be overwhelming to many patients.  It has shown benefits with nausea, migraines, and pain relief. 

Works great for SCROG — watch out at the end of flower, because true Trainwreck almost always gets hermaphrodite flowers appearing late in the cycle… often they're impotent, but it's wise to keep a close eye on them to avoid pollinating itself and other plants in your garden.

Triangle is a super-rare clone-only strain that originates in Florida. The name comes from the three marijuana-producing capitals of Florida, which are Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa. Many people believe that Triangle is the mother of the OG Kush genetic line, as it was around in the early 1990s and carries all the hallmarks of a world-class OG Kush.

Unverified

The very large, teardrop-shaped calyxes result in super-dense buds which are covered in a thick layer of some of the largest trichome heads we've ever seen.

It has perhaps the most pure and strongest OG Kush aroma we've encountered, with a pungent blend of lemons, spice, and floor cleaner that will raise the eyebrow of anyone questioning the "mother of OG Kush" story.  To us, it tastes and smells like Ghost's OG Kush on steroids — just more of everything.

Pine, gas, fuel that OG Kush is famous for.

The effect is similar to OG Kush as well, but with a fairly large step up in potency, felt much more strongly in the eyes and face than Ghost's OG and at times bordering on racy to start.  Mental processes are clear and active, sociability and creativity is stimulated, but the body has a wonderful warming, floaty relaxation the entire time.

This is one of the real "crusher sativas" that almost mimics an indica couch lock with its oppressive head high. We've found this in other diesels as well. The popularity of the standard Sour Diesel has pushed forward the palette for various Diesel varieties. 

Sour Diesel x Strawberry Diesel x NYC Diesel,

Soily and slightly sweet in the jar, it breaks up to produce a fresh menthol-tinged soil scent when handled. It reminded one reviewer of freshly torn mint leaves… The pungency was pretty average, but it was enough to be noticed without being right near the bud.

Not as tasty as we expected, it was a pretty standard Diesel type taste, with a soil tinge similar to what was presented in the smell. There were no traces of the NYCD or Strawberry Diesel influence with their brand of sweetness, it was mostly just a fuel and soil taste, but not a particularly pungent one. It burned down to a medium-light gray ash, showing that it had an above-average flush job.

Major cerebral soaring rush, facial and occular pressure building for 30 minutes or more. The head high stays put but disconnects the legs, so while a crushing sativa experience is had there is no real movement unless it is necessary.

Crossed from ho-hum commercial strains (Afghani and Skunk #1), this plant was a bit of a surprise for Gerrit Slot, the owner/founder of Magus Genetics.  The plant shows some Sativa-dominant traits such as its high calyx-to-leaf ratio, its stretch after start of flowering, and its overall "up" effects. It's a branchy plant that is easy to manicure due to low amounts of leaves — the finished smell is generally a strong sweet/sour, slightly fruity combo.

Skunk #1 x Afghani

After coming up with the cross out of necessity and discovering how potent the resulting plant was, Gerrit Slot hooked up with the Bluebird, a very popular coffeeshop in Amsterdam — this began to build the following for Warlock.  He essentially stopped breeding experiments with the Warlock at that point and simply kept it going by cloning the mother over and over again.  Eventually the Warlock would used in almost every cross that Magus Genetics offers. 

A strong, sweet, and sometimes sour aroma that is of the fruity variety.

A sharp, somewhat hashy taste going in, with a sweet and soft fruitiness on the exhale.  The smoke can be a bit on the harsh and expansive side.

A quality hybrid strain, the Warlock starts off with a mixed bag of Sativa effects such as a slightly pounding heart, a heady start, and a bit of anxiety/paranoia.  However, it calmed down rather quickly and provided a relaxing, even body-centric experience that lasted 2+ hours.  It showed benefits in general relaxation, pain relief, and sleep aid towards the end of the experience.

Grows well in any medium — suggested grow style is to let the plants veg from seed for ~35 days and then kick them into flower.  There is an outdoor Warlock from Magus called "Biddy Early" (Warlock x Early Skunk F2) that took 2nd Prize at the 2003 High times Cannabis Cup for the Sativa category, beating out indoor-grown competition.

Here is a stunning example of OGRaskal's White Fire OG, this one grown from seed stock and selected in Boulder, CO. The #2 designation is not anything permanent or reflecting upon the WiFi population at-large, but simply reflects the chosen plant number from this particular selection project. This cut has been gaining an incredible reputation in the elite genetics community, both because of the Fire OG Kush (one of the most sought-after OG cuts to this day) and Krome's The White (a less-rare but still elite OG-based cut out of Florida) — for Kush-lovers, it doesn't get much better than the "Wi-Fi OG.”

Fire OG Kush x The White

Bred by OGRaskal, released as a limited seed release

With a tight nug structure more reminiscent of the Fire OG than the large pinecone-shaped buds of The White, this particular WiFi has the perfect blend of density and attractive trichome/calyx structure, keeping thing open enough to see but possessing a very satisfying nuggy texture.

The Fire OG is definitely the predominant aroma and flavor present in this cut, with a perfect slightly spicy OG flavor rife with gingery citrus terpenes and a kerosene-like kick that comes out when it's disturbed.

This is a strain which when properly-grown has a deep, abiding flavor which lasts through the end of a joint and leaves a lingering OG flavor on the lips and in the throat whick rivals some of the best we've encountered.

Wonderfully uplifting yet deeply powerful effect, which comes on strongly from the first hit and stays around for well over 3 hours.  It's felt immediately in the face and eyes, but doesn't make the eyes feel squinty or dry, but rather just provides a constantly pulsing pressure and warmth which is pleasant to most patients.  Mentally it's just a strain that wipes away stress and tensions and provides a humorous, light-hearted mood elevation which is very smooth and without any anxiety or raciness. or raciness.

White OG is one of the hardest hitting indicas in most collections. Settling in late during the curing stage, the terpenes present in White OG are subtle but very fruity. At harvest though, and when just packaged, the buds seem generic, albeit covered in trichomes. Give this a couple weeks in your jar and you can observe aromas build to a complex richness to be savored.

The White x OG Kush

Chrome's The White is predominant against the OG Kush it was bred to achieve this strain.

Covered in trichomes, it is frosty-white as the name implies. Small, spherical buds are typical, with very little stem and particularly dense.

Mango fruit punch, when cured more than a month.

Thick, woody smoke, indicative of OG Kush, is typical and can be a bit harsh for new comers. Again, as the bud ages in the jar (and this isn't just a generic statement) the flavors develop to an intense complexity. The trick is keeping a stash around long enough to experience this phenomenon. 

Heavy indica qualities, including ambivilance, loss of focus, body relaxation and if tolerance is low, body dissociation can result from a heavy dose.

            Coming off of the success of White Widow, Greenhouse seeds wanted to combine the notorious potency of that strain with something that yielded slightly more and was even easier to grow.  The results of that breeding project is White Rhino, a more Indica-dominant version of the Widow.  After the split of Greenhouse Seeds founder Shantibaba from the company, he re-packaged the strain as "Medicine Man", retaining the original genetics.  Nirvana Seeds is known for creating versions of famous strains, and this is no exception — most people consider the Nirvana version of lesser quality and prefer the Mr. Nice version over any other.

            Very potent and resinous, White Rhino takes after its Afghani father, with a strong and sedative body effect that comes on quickly after first hitting the eyes.  Borderline narcotic, it's best as a nighttime or lazy day medicine, as it can become difficult to do much of anything while in its grip.  Strong sedative qualities make this strain a good medical choice for mental and physical relaxation, anti-anxiety, sleep aid, and pain relief qualities. 

            An easy-to-grow plant, it will do well in either soil or hydro, with soil bringing out the most flavor.

Developed in 1994 by Green House Seeds/Coffeeshop in Amsterdam, White Widow has gone on to win prizes and become one of the most popular and notorious strains in the world.  After the split of Shantibaba (and later, Neville Schoenmaker and Howard Marks) from Green House Seeds, they formed Mr. Nice Seedbank and re-created the strain from the original parent genetics, re-naming it "Black Widow," as they lost the rights to the original name.  Many people prefer the Black Widow to the current Green House version.

A blend of fruit and musky, putrid qualities — it hints at its potency with the smell, which has more of a bite to it than many fruity-smelling strains.  At times, it's all lemons and hashiness, depends a bit on the phenotype. 

Often times neutral or even hashy due to the high trichome count, the strain sometimes has a citrusy, flowery finish, but is not known for being all that flavorful in general. 

Cerebral and uplifting, this strain is powerful and consistent.  Though White Widow keeps you mentally active and positive, it often comes with a strong couchlock tendency, especially later in the duration.  If harvested late, this strain can be especially narcotic for a sativa and can make a mid-day nap a necessity. 

Indoor is best for this strain and it flowers more quickly than when grown outdoors — Shantibaba recommends to keep the moisture level low to prevent mildew and to keep the fertilization schedule fairly light as well to let the flavors come out.

White 91 (Krome's The White x Chem91 Skunk VA) X Girl Scout Cookies

Bred by Tierra Rojo - In his own words, "Using the Girl Scout Cookies "Forum Cut" as the mother and a freak White '91 (Krome's The White x ChemDawg '91 Skunk VA) male as the pollen source, this hybrid produces plants which mostly resemble the GSC in structure, but with an additional boost of trichome density and aroma from the pungent White '91 line. The Chem '91 part of the equation adds a needed boost of sharp flavor which enhances the often musky-minty terpene profile of the GSC."

Not the Wookies highlighted on the Green Dot Labs website (by Bodhi), this is the Tierra Rojo creation of 2012-2013 vintage.

The flowers and the plant both resemble an OG/Triangle/White structure of plant, with a bit less stretching than the traditional clone-only OG cuts do.

Very OG Kush smelling, the White side providing the profile if not the pungency (something The White is oft void of entirely).

As Tierra Rojo promises, the Wookies has a more dominant Chemdog profile to the pallete bringing in a lemon sour component to the traditional sweet/musky mouth of the GSC forum cut.

Pushy indica hybrid hitiing the sour and piney terpene components across the board.

A good strain for novice growers, Haoma is cultivated both outdoors and in with a flowering period of 7 to 8 weeks.indicaHaomaNot much is known about the California-bred hybrid Happy Rancher, but this hybrid strain has nevertheless carved a name for itself among West Coast genetics. Its name and initial appeal lies primarily in Happy Rancher's sour candied aroma, although there's also something to be said about its high-flying euphoria and colorful buds. Coated with a sticky blanket of sugar-like resin, Happy Rancher is a treat for all the senses.hybridHappy RancherAn indica-dominant cross between Big Bud and DJ Short Blueberry, Hardcore OG is a California strain bred with the stalwart cannabis veteran in mind. Its dense, pungent buds produce thick coats of resin that can be extracted for potent (and we mean potent) concentrates. The weight of this sedating indica sinks throughout the body, submerging stress, pain, and other ailments under its crushing THC content.indicaHardcore OGHarle-Tsu, bred by the Southern Humboldt Seed Collective, is a high-CBD hybrid cross between Harlequin and Sour Tsunami. With a CBD content 20 times higher than its THC content, Harle-Tsu brings relief to pain and inflammation without psychoactivity. Harle-Tsu seeds have a 75% chance of expressing its high-CBD characteristics, and indoor plants will finish flowering in 8 weeks.hybridHarle-TsuHarlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and Thai and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THC's paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.sativaHarlequinKnown by many names, Harlequin GDP is a CBD-dominant cross of Harlequin and Granddaddy Purple. This earthy, slightly sweet sativa-dominant hybrid has been seen with a 3:1 CBD/THC ratio, slotting it firmly as a medicinal strain while offering enough THC whizbang for recreational cannabis consumers.

With an aroma of sweet lemon and berries, Harmonia delivers functional, clear-headed effects that allow you to stay active and productive throughout the day. Don't confuse Harmonia with its sister strain Pokie, who inherits a high-THC and low-CBD chemical profile despite being bred from the same parent genetics.indicaHarmoniaHarmony is a hybrid that synchronizes the very best of its three parent strains, Santa Marta Colombian Gold, Lemon OG Kush, and Lemon Thai. These tall plants produce flowery, lemon-smelling buds distinctly kush-like in structure. Its effects are invigorating and uplifting, but higher doses might push you into a more spacey experience. Indoor growers wait 8 to 9 weeks for Harmony to flower while outdoor cultivators prepare for harvest in the month of October.hybridHarmonyHarry Potter is an otherworldly hybrid strain that crosses Blissful Wizard with Fire Alien Kush. Bred by Sasquatch Gardens in California, Harry Potter casts a pacifying spell over the body, easing aches and pains while hushing anxiety.hybridHarry PotterOne of Sensi Seeds's classics, Hash Plant stays compact during her extra-short flowering time. Her tight, resin-drenched flower clusters develop a brittle surface when dried and give off a deep, rich Afghani aroma that's undercut with a hint of hashish. When consumed, her dominant flavor is the spicy-sharp bite of smouldering resin glands. The instant vaporization of those layers of sparkling trichomes accelerates Hash Plant's rapid, blissful and breathtakingly powerful body-stone. This 90% indica is the product of careful genetic selection, a process that involved matching the mysterious Hash Plant original from the U.S. with Northern Lights.indicaHash PlantIn the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows. Sativa strains were too large and took too long, while many indica strains smelled too strongly to go unnoticed. Enter the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant, a compact, quick-flowering, low-odor plant that still delivers large yields and tons of resin. Archive Seed Bank crossed this plant with their favorite male, the Face Off OG backcross, to create Hashbar OG, a 70% indica-dominant hybrid that generates THC levels between 20% and 24%. While the smell of this strain is light, it still delivers a nice OG flavor when smoked.indicaHashbar OGVoted Strain of the Year by High Times in 2006, Hashberry has a classic indica flavor with hashish undertones.

Toward the end, a body sensation begins but leaves the consumer still social and active.indicaHashberryThe uplifting high of the Hashplant Haze is enjoyable throughout the day due to it's being a sativa dominant strain.

These plants grow tall and flower slowly, taking between 12 and 14 weeks, so they are probably better suited for a grower with some experience and patience.sativaHawaiian HazeWhat do you get when you cross two of the most potent equatorial sativa strains and plant them in the volcanic soil of paradise? You get Hawaiian Mayan Gold by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian  Pakalolo  Seed Bank. This cross of Kona Gold and Colombian Mojito landraces produces massive sativa spears that reach for the sky.

Patients swear by this Hawaiian and Purple Kush cross for treatment of pain, insomnia, and muscle relaxation.indicaHawaiian Purple KushHawaiian Sativa is a pure sativa strain that heads straight to the head with little to no body effects for some consumers. The head effects might be a little intense for new consumers or those looking for more calming effects. Hawaiian Sativa has also earned the nickname  banana pot,  not because of its tropical heritage, but because it grows long, curved flowers that resemble the fruit. These  banana buds  actually smell and taste more like citrus, but their added length provides plenty of room for sticky resin, making this a potent strain with high THC levels. Since its effects are so active, this strain is popular for daytime consumption and has shown effectiveness as a treatment for glaucoma patients. As a true sativa, Hawaiian Sativa plants grow tall and take a full 12 weeks to flower, but the rewards are plentiful for the patient grower.sativaHawaiian SativaHawaiian Skunk is an outdoor plant that offers high THC content (evidenced by dense crystals) with few growing difficulties. A cross between Hawaiian Indica and Skunk #1, this light green, poppy bud suggests the uplifting, sativa-dominant buzz it induces.

This strain represents old school Hawaiian genetics and stimulates while imbuing the consumer with a content, mellow haze.sativaHawai'i '78The illustrious Haze sativa first took root in Santa Cruz, California during the 1960s where long growing seasons accommodated her lengthy flowering cycle. Since then, Haze has become the proud parent of countless hybrids around the globe, passing on its genetics from Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and South India. Although Haze cultivators must wait patiently for Haze flowers to reach full maturation, few strains can match the high-energy, creative buzz provided by this sativa staple. Haze's aroma is typically characterized by a spicy scent accented by hints of citrus and earthy sweetness.sativaHazeA cross between Super Silver Haze and DJ Short's famous Blueberry, Haze Berry is an 80% sativa hybrid that has become quite popular for its combination of sweet berry, indica-like flavors and sativa highs. As you might expect from a plant with two extremely potent parents, Haze Berry routinely tests at well over 20% THC, and some cultivars have a significant amount of CBD as well. In addition, it provides higher than average yields and a relatively short flowering time of 9-10 weeks, making this a very attractive strain for sativa enthusiasts. Haze Berry gives the consumer a euphoric, creativity-inducing high that gradually gives way to a profound sensation of relaxation and well-being.sativaHaze BerryBred by Soma Seeds, Haze Heaven is a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid whose classic genetics derive from Northern Lights #5, Haze, Afghani, and Hawaiian.

Hints of musk and spice can be detected on the inhale, balancing flavors from both indica and sativa sides of the family. This variety still takes about 10 to 11 weeks to finish flowering, but growers with enough skill to successfully cultivate Haze Heaven are typically rewarded with generous yields.hybridHaze HeavenYou could call Haze Wreck the  perfect storm  of sativas, as it unites the lineages of two legendary strains, Haze and Trainwreck.

T. H. Seeds bred this West Coast native from local (and locally named) favorites Killing Garberville, Seattle Big Bud, and Mendocino Hash Plant to create a multi-skilled strain. Growers should be aware that plants do not always have classic seven-point leaves, but her unique beauty does not affect her output. Heavy Duty Fruity also gives off a heavy duty sweet smell, so it may require management for indoor growers. What is not a concern is yield and bud size, both of which are consistently large with this strain, both indoors and out. Plants usually flower between 8 and 9 weeks. Depending on when this plant is harvested, her effects range from psychedelic and spacey to mellow relaxation.hybridHeavy Duty FruityHeisenberg Kush is a cross of SC Blue Dream and Sin City Kush bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds as part of their Great Minds series of genetics.

Growers also like this strain for its hybrid resilience and its 8 week flowering time.hybridMaster YodaSince many marijuana strains hail from the tropics or specific breeding hubs, it's no surprise that this Alaskan hybrid's name celebrates its origins. Developed from strains grown in Matanuska Valley's grasslands, the flowers on these plants develop a frosting of icy white hairs that bring to mind its snowy homeland. Despite its rugged roots, these plants do best indoors but will still yield well in outdoor dry climates for the experienced grower. They will remain squat in size but tend to have very large leaves. This strain smells like hot chocolate with fruit, the latter of which can dominate the taste. Matanuska's effects tend to come on slowly and then give a strong body buzz.

Bred by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian  Pakalolo  Seed Bank, Maui Haole takes powerful influence from the original Romulan Joe cut of Romulan. Its uplifting sativa influence stems from Maui Wowie genetics sourced from the Lower Nahiku region of Hawaii.

Since its beginnings in the island's volcanic soil, Maui Wowie has spread across the world to bless us with its sweet pineapple flavors and high-energy euphoria. Lightweight sativa effects allow your mind to drift away to creative escapes, while Maui Wowie's motivating, active effects may be all you need to get outside and enjoy the sun. This tall, lanky strain is best suited for cultivation in warm, tropical climates that mirror its homeland, but a bright environment and nutrient-rich soil are typically adequate for indoor growth.sativaMaui WowieA legendary strain grown in the far north of Afghanistan.  In fertile and well-irrigated soils these vigorous giants are capable of reaching 4 metres in height or more, and will produce a similarly immense yield of intensely resinous flowers.

Pine, mint, and spice aromas burst from MediHaze buds in a fragrant introduction to its clear-headed, uplifting effects.sativaMediHazeMedibud (or Medi Bud) is an uplifting hybrid strain of unknown genetic origins, but many attribute its upbeat, active effects to sativa parentage. Others claim Medibud is a 60/40 indica-dominant cross, so it's possible that this strain expresses itself in various phenotypes. Typically, you can expect high-energy euphoria and heightened sensory awareness from Medibud, but its indica-leaning phenotypes may induce heavier, more relaxing effects.hybridMedibudMedicine Man delivers potent pain relief and high levels of THC and CBDs, making it a popular recommendation for many medical conditions from headaches and migraines to chronic pain management. Its heritage lies in Brazilian, Indian, and Afghani strains, though Medicine Man is sometimes mistaken to be its close family member, White Rhino.

Bred by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian Pakalōlō Seed Bank, Maui Haole takes powerful influence from the original Romulan Joe cut of Romulan.

Haole is a Hawaiian term for a foreigner or someone that is not native to Hawaii, and Romulan is an alien race from the legendary sci-fi series Star Trek.

This pure sativa landrace is sometimes called “Thai Sticks” because of the way its buds are traditionally dried and tied into long sticks. This original Thai variety has given rise to many strains we commonly see on the market today, including Voodoo, Juicy Fruit, and the classic Haze. Thai induces powerful but comfortable effects and has a distinct fruity, citrus aroma.

Its yellow-green flowers should be sticky and will give off a spicy and skunky scent that Haze lovers will recognize. The taste also includes an earthy sweetness that is telling of its Thai genetics. Effects can be slow to come on, but be careful: once they do, the almost psychedelic effects of “haze brain” are definitely possible side effects.Thai-HazesativaUplifted,Happy,Euphoric,Relaxed,EnergeticEarthy,Spicy/Herbal,PineThai Lights is a sativa-dominant blend that crosses the uplifting effects of Thai sativas with the stable and robust Northern Lights.
